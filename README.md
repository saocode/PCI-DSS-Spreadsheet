NSCs examine all network traffic entering (ingress) and leaving (egress) a segment and decide, based on the policies defined, whether the network traffic is allowed to pass or whether it should be rejected. Typically, NSCs are placed between environments with different security needs or levels of trust, however in some environments NSCs control the traffic to individual devices irrespective of trust boundaries. Policy enforcement generally occurs at layer 3 of the OSI model, but data present in higher layers is also frequently used to determine policy decisions. Traditionally this function has been provided by physical firewalls; however, now this functionality may be provided by virtual devices, cloud access controls, virtualization/container systems, and other software-defined networking technology. NSCs are used to control traffic within an entity’s own networks—for example, between highly sensitive and less sensitive areas—and also to protect the entity’s resources from exposure to untrusted networks. The cardholder data environment (CDE) is an example of a more sensitive area within an entity’s network. Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways into sensitive systems. NSCs provide a key protection mechanism for any computer network. Common examples of untrusted networks include the Internet, dedicated connections such as business-to-business communication channels, wireless networks, carrier networks (such as cellular), third-party networks, and other sources outside the entity’s ability to control. Furthermore, untrusted networks also include corporate networks that are considered out-of-scope for PCI DSS, because they are not assessed, and therefore must be treated as untrusted because the existence of security controls has not been verified. While an entity may consider an internal network to be trusted from an infrastructure perspective, if a network is out of scope for PCI DSS, that network must be considered untrusted for PCI DSS.

While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 1, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For these reasons, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

formally assigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities may not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed

Configuration standards may also outline what the entity considers not acceptable or not permitted within its network.DefinitionsNSCs are key components of a network architecture. Most commonly, NSCs are used at the boundaries of the CDE to control network traffic flowing inbound and outbound from the CDE.Configuration standards outline an entity’s minimum requirements for the configuration of its NSCs.ExamplesExamples of NSCs covered by these configuration standards include, but are not limited to, firewalls, routers configured with access control lists, and cloud virtual networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Interview responsible personnel and examine change control records to verify that identified changes to network connections were approved and managed in accordance with Requirement 6.5.1.1.2.2.c Examine network configuration settings to identify changes made to configurations of NSCs. Interview responsible personnel and examine change control records to verify that identified changes to configurations of NSCs were approved and managed in accordance with Requirement 6.5.1.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | PurposeFollowing a structured change control process for all changes to NSCs reduces the risk that a change could introduce a security vulnerability.Good PracticeChanges should be approved by individuals with the appropriate authority and knowledge to understand the impact of the change. Verification should provide reasonable assurance that the change did not adversely impact the security of the network and that the change performs as expected.To avoid having to address security issues introduced by a change, all changes should be approved prior to being implemented and verified after the change is implemented.

Additionally, services, protocols, and ports that are enabled but not in use are often overlooked and left unsecured and unpatched. By identifying the services, protocols, and ports necessary for business, entities can ensure that all other services, protocols, and ports are disabled or removed.Good PracticeThe security risk associated with each service, protocol, and port allowed should be understood. Approvals should be granted by personnel independent of those managing the configuration. Approving personnel should possess knowledge and accountability appropriate for making approval decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

posed by these services, protocols, and ports should be clearly understood and accepted by the organization, the use of the service, protocol, or port should be justified, and the security features that mitigate the risk of using these services, protocols, and ports should be defined and implemented by the entity.Further InformationFor guidance on services, protocols, or ports considered to be insecure, refer to industry standards and guidance (for example, from NIST, ENISA, OWASP).

Furthermore, it ensures that all rules and configurations allow only authorized services, protocols, and ports that match the documented business justifications.Good PracticeThis review, which can be implemented using manual, automated, or system-based methods, is intended to confirm that the settings that manage traffic rules, what is allowed in and out of the network, match the approved configurations.The review should provide confirmation that all permitted access has a justified business reason. Any discrepancies or uncertainties about a rule or configuration should be escalated for resolution.While this requirement specifies that this review occur at least once every six months, organizations with a high volume of changes to their network configurations may wish to consider performing reviews more frequently to ensure that the configurations continue to meet the needs of the business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

kept up to date and secured against unauthorized changes.Keeping configuration information current and secure ensures that the correct settings for NSCs are applied whenever the configuration is run.ExamplesIf the secure configuration for a router is stored in non-volatile memory, when that router is restarted or rebooted, these controls should ensure that its secure configuration is reinstated.

Connections should be inspected to ensure traffic is restricted to only authorized communications—for example, by restricting source/destination addresses and ports, and blocking of content.ExamplesImplementing a rule that denies all inbound and outbound traffic that is not specifically needed— for example, by using an explicit “deny all” or implicit deny after allow statement—helps to prevent inadvertent holes that would allow unintended and potentially harmful traffic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Connections should be inspected to restrict traffic to only authorized communications—for example, by restricting source/destination addresses and ports, and blocking of content.ExamplesImplementing a rule that denies all inbound and outbound traffic that is not specifically needed— for example, by using an explicit “deny all” or implicit deny after allow statement—helps to prevent inadvertent holes that would allow unintended and potentially harmful traffic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If NSCs do not restrict access from wireless networks into the CDE, malicious individuals that gain unauthorized access to the wireless network can easily connect to the CDE and compromise account information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Please note that if an entity’s DMZ processes or transmits account data (for example, e-commerce website), it is also considered a CDE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This functionality is intended to prevent malicious actors from accessing the organization's internal network from the Internet, or from using services, protocols, or ports in an unauthorized manner.Where this functionality is provided as a built-in feature of an NSC, the entity should ensure that its configurations do not result in the functionality being disabled or bypassed.DefinitionsMaintaining the "state" (or status) for each connection into a network means the NSC “knows” whether an apparent response to a previous connection is a valid, authorized response (since the NSC retains each connection’s status) or whether it is malicious traffic trying to fool the NSC into allowing the connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Entities should consult the vendor's documentation for more information.ExamplesNormally, a packet contains the IP address of the computer that originally sent it so other computers in the network know where the packet originated.Malicious individuals will often try to spoof (or imitate) the sending IP address to fool the target system into believing the packet is from a trusted source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1.4.4     | Defined Approach Requirements1.4.4 System components that store cardholder data are not directly accessible from untrusted networks.Customized Approach ObjectiveStored cardholder data cannot be accessed from untrusted networks.Applicability NotesThis requirement is not intended to apply to storage of account data in volatile memory but does apply where memory is being treated as persistent storage (for example, RAM disk). Account data can only be stored in volatile memory during the time necessary to support the associated business process (for example, until completion of the related payment card transaction).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Defined Approach Testing Procedures1.4.4.a Examine the data-flow diagram and network diagram to verify that it is documented that system components storing cardholder data are not directly accessible from the untrusted networks.1.4.4.b Examine configurations of NSCs to verify that controls are implemented such that system components storing cardholder data are not directly accessible from untrusted networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | PurposeCardholder data that is directly accessible from an untrusted network, for example, because it is stored on a system within the DMZ or in a cloud database service, is easier for an external attacker to access because there are fewer defensive layers to penetrate. Using NSCs to ensure that system components that store cardholder data (such as a database or a file) can only be directly accessed from trusted networks can prevent unauthorized network traffic from reaching the system component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

For example, the controls used to meet this requirement may be different for IPv4 networks than for IPv6 networks.ExamplesMethods to obscure IP addressing may include, but are not limited to:• IPv4 Network Address Translation (NAT).• Placing system components behind proxy servers/NSCs.• Removal or filtering of route advertisements for internal networks that use registered addressing.• Internal use of RFC 1918 (IPv4) or use IPv6 privacy extension (RFC 4941) when initiating outgoing sessions to the internet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 1.5.1     | Defined Approach Requirements1.5.1 Security controls are implemented on any computing devices, including company- and employee-owned devices, that connect to both untrusted networks (including the Internet) and the CDE as follows:• Specific configuration settings are defined to prevent threats being introduced into the entity’s network.• Security controls are actively running.• Security controls are not alterable by users of the computing devices unless specifically documented and authorized by management on a case-by-case basis for a limited period.Customized Approach ObjectiveDevices that connect to untrusted environments and also connect to the CDE cannot introduce threats to the entity’s CDE.Applicability NotesThese security controls may be temporarily disabled only if there is legitimate technical need, as authorized by management on a case-by-case basis. If these security controls need to be disabled for a specific purpose, it must be formally authorized. Additional security measures may also need to be implemented for the period during which these security controls are not active.This requirement applies to employee-owned and company-owned computing devices. Systems that cannot be managed by corporate policy introduce weaknesses and provide opportunities that malicious individuals may exploit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Defined Approach Testing Procedures1.5.1.a Examine policies and configuration standards and interview personnel to verify security controls for computing devices that connect to both untrusted networks, and the CDE, are implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.1.5.1.b Examine configuration settings on computing devices that connect to both untrusted networks and the CDE to verify settings are implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | PurposeComputing devices that are allowed to connect to the Internet from outside the corporate environment—for example, desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other mobile computing devices used by employees—are more vulnerable to Internet-based threats.Use of security controls such as host-based controls (for example, personal firewall software or end-point protection solutions), network-based security controls (for example, firewalls, network- based heuristics inspection, and malware simulation), or hardware, helps to protect devices from Internet-based attacks, which could use the device to gain access to the organization’s systems and data when the device reconnects to the network.(continued on next page)Good PracticeThe specific configuration settings are determined by the entity and should be consistent with its network security policies and procedures.Where there is a legitimate need to temporarily disable security controls on a company-owned or employee-owned device that connects to both an untrusted network and the CDE—for example, to support a specific maintenance activity or investigation of a technical problem—the reason for taking such action is understood and approved by an appropriate management representative. Any disabling or altering of these security controls, including on administrators’ own devices, is performed by authorized personnel.It is recognized that administrators have privileges that may allow them to disable security controls on their own computers, but there should be alerting mechanisms in place when such controls are disabled and follow up that occurs to ensure processes were followed.ExamplesPractices include forbidding split-tunneling of VPNs for employee-owned or corporate-owned mobile devices and requiring that such devices boot up into a VPN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

These passwords and settings are well known and are easily determined via public information. Applying secure configurations to system components reduces the means available to an attacker to compromise the system. Changing default passwords, removing unnecessary software, functions, and accounts, and disabling or removing unnecessary services all help to reduce the potential attack surface.

formally assigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities may not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix).

Fixing security vulnerabilities reduces the opportunities available to an attacker.By developing standards, entities ensure their system components will be configured consistently and securely and will address the protection of devices for which full hardening may be more difficult.Good PracticeKeeping up to date with current industry guidance will help the entity maintain secure configurations.The specific controls to be applied to a system will vary and should be appropriate for the type and function of the system.Numerous security organizations have established system-hardening guidelines and recommendations, which advise how to correct common, known weaknesses.Further InformationSources for guidance on configuration standards include but are not limited to: Center for Internet Security (CIS), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Cloud Security Alliance, and product vendors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2.2.2     | Defined Approach Requirements2.2.2 Vendor default accounts are managed as follows:• If the vendor default account(s) will be used, the default password is changed per Requirement 8.3.6.• If the vendor default account(s) will not be used, the account is removed or disabled.Customized Approach ObjectiveSystem components cannot be accessed using default passwords.Applicability NotesThis applies to ALL vendor default accounts and passwords, including, but not limited to, those used by operating systems, software that provides security services, application and system accounts, point-of-sale (POS) terminals, payment applications, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) defaults.This requirement also applies where a system component is not installed within an entity’s environment, for example, software and applications that are part of the CDE and are accessed via a cloud subscription service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Defined Approach Testing Procedures2.2.2.a Examine system configuration standards to verify they include managing vendor default accounts in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.2.2.2.b Examine vendor documentation and observe a system administrator logging on using vendor default accounts to verify accounts are implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.2.2.2.c Examine configuration files and interview personnel to verify that all vendor default accounts that will not be used are removed or disabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | PurposeMalicious individuals often use vendor default account names and passwords to compromise operating systems, applications, and the systems on which they are installed. Because these default settings are often published and are well known, changing these settings will make systems less vulnerable to attack.Good PracticeAll vendor default accounts should be identified, and their purpose and use understood. It is important to establish controls for application and system accounts, including those used to deploy and maintain cloud services so that they do not use default passwords and are not usable by unauthorized individuals.Where a default account is not intended to be used, changing the default password to a unique password that meets PCI DSS Requirement 8.3.6, removing any access to the default account, and then disabling the account, will prevent a malicious individual from re-enabling the account and gaining access with the default password.Using an isolated staging network to install and configure new systems is recommended and can also be used to confirm that default credentials have not been introduced into production environments.ExamplesDefaults to be considered include user IDs, passwords, and other authentication credentials commonly used by vendors in their products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

For example, systems that need to be directly connected to the Internet would have a particular profile, like a DNS server, web server, or an e-commerce server. Conversely, other system components may operate a primary function comprising a different set of services, protocols, and daemons that perform functions that an entity does not want exposed to the Internet. This requirement aims to ensure that different functions do not impact the security profiles of other services in a way which may cause them to operate at a higher or lower security level.Good PracticeIdeally, each function should be placed on different system components. This can be achieved by implementing only one primary function on each system component. Another option is to isolate primary functions on the same system component that have different security levels, for example, isolating web servers (which need to be directly connected to the Internet) from application and database servers.(continued on next page)If a system component contains primary functions that need different security levels, a third option is to implement additional controls to ensure that the resultant security level of the primary function(s) with higher security needs is not reduced by the presence of the lower security primary functions. Additionally, the functions with a lower security level should be isolated and/or secured to ensure they cannot access or affect the resources of another system function, and do not introduce security weaknesses to other functions on the same server.Functions of differing security levels may be isolated by either physical or logical controls. For example, a database system should not also be hosting web services unless using controls like virtualization technologies to isolate and contain the functions into separate sub-systems. Another example is using virtual instances or providing dedicated memory access by system function.Where virtualization technologies are used, the security levels should be identified and managed for each virtual component. Examples of considerations for virtualized environments include:• The function of each application, container, or virtual server instance.• How virtual machines (VMs) or containers are stored and secured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

By removing or disabling all unnecessary services, protocols, daemons, and functions, organizations can focus on securing the functions that are required and reduce the risk that unknown or unnecessary functions will be exploited.Good PracticeThere are many protocols that could be enabled by default that are commonly used by malicious individuals to compromise a network. Disabling or removing all services, functions, and protocols that are not used minimizes the potential attack surface—for example, by removing or disabling an unused FTP or web server.ExamplesUnnecessary functionality may include, but is not limited to scripts, drivers, features, subsystems, file systems, interfaces (USB and Bluetooth), and unnecessary web servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

A malicious individual could use this information to access the network, become administrator, and steal data.Good PracticeWhichever security protocol is used, it should be configured to use only secure versions and configurations to prevent use of an insecure connection—for example, by using only trusted certificates, supporting only strong encryption, and not supporting fallback to weaker, insecure protocols or methods.ExamplesCleartext protocols (such as HTTP, telnet, etc.) do not encrypt traffic or logon details, making it easy for an eavesdropper to intercept this information. Non-console access may be facilitated by technologies that provide alternative access to systems, including but not limited to, out-of-band (OOB), lights-out management (LOM), Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI), and keyboard, video, mouse (KVM) switches with remote capabilities. These and other non-console access technologies and methods must be secured with strong cryptography.Further InformationRefer to industry standards and best practices such as NIST SP 800-52 and SP 800-57.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 2.3.1     | Defined Approach Requirements2.3.1 For wireless environments connected to the CDE or transmitting account data, all wireless vendor defaults are changed at installation or are confirmed to be secure, including but not limited to:• Default wireless encryption keys.• Passwords on wireless access points.• SNMP defaults.• Any other security-related wireless vendor defaults.Customized Approach ObjectiveWireless networks cannot be accessed using vendor default passwords or default configurations.Applicability NotesThis includes, but is not limited to, default wireless encryption keys, passwords on wireless access points, SNMP defaults, and any other security- related wireless vendor defaults.

                                     | Defined Approach Testing Procedures2.3.1.a Examine policies and procedures and interview responsible personnel to verify that processes are defined for wireless vendor defaults to either change them upon installation or to confirm them to be secure in accordance with all elements of this requirement.2.3.1.b Examine vendor documentation and observe a system administrator logging into wireless devices to verify:• SNMP defaults are not used.• Default passwords/passphrases on wireless access points are not used.2.3.1.c Examine vendor documentation and wireless configuration settings to verify other security-related wireless vendor defaults were changed, if applicable.

                                              | PurposeIf wireless networks are not implemented with sufficient security configurations (including changing default settings), wireless sniffers can eavesdrop on the traffic, easily capture data and passwords, and easily enter and attack the network.Good PracticeWireless passwords should be constructed so that they are resistant to offline brute force attacks.

                             | PurposeChanging wireless encryption keys whenever someone with knowledge of the key leaves the organization or moves to a role that no longer requires knowledge of the key, helps keep knowledge of keys limited to only those with a business need to know.Also, changing wireless encryption keys whenever a key is suspected or known to be comprised makes a wireless network more resistant to compromise.Good PracticeThis goal can be accomplished in multiple ways, including periodic changes of keys, changing keys via a defined “joiners-movers-leavers” (JML) process, implementing additional technical controls, and not using fixed pre-shared keys.In addition, any keys that are known to be, or suspected of being, compromised should be managed in accordance with the entity’s incident response plan at Requirement 12.10.1.

If an intruder circumvents other security controls and gains access to encrypted account data, the data is unreadable without the proper cryptographic keys and is unusable to that intruder. Other effective methods of protecting stored data should also be considered as potential risk-mitigation opportunities. For example, methods for minimizing risk include not storing account data unless necessary, truncating cardholder data if full PAN is not needed, and not sending unprotected PANs using end-user messaging technologies such as e-mail and instant messaging. If account data is present in non-persistent memory (for example, RAM, volatile memory), encryption of PAN is not required. However, proper controls must be in place to ensure that memory maintains a non-persistent state. Data should be removed from volatile memory once the business purpose (for example, the associated transaction) is complete. In the case that data storage becomes persistent, all applicable PCI DSS Requirements will apply including encryption of stored data. Requirement 3 applies to protection of stored account data unless specifically called out in an individual requirement.

While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 3, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

not formally assigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities, and critical activities may not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix).

| 3.2.1     | Defined Approach Requirements3.2.1 Account data storage is kept to a minimum through implementation of data retention and disposal policies, procedures, and processes that include at least the following:• Coverage for all locations of stored account data.• Coverage for any sensitive authentication data (SAD) stored prior to completion of authorization. This bullet is a best practice until its effective date; refer to Applicability Notes below for details.• Limiting data storage amount and retention time to that which is required for legal or regulatory, and/or business requirements.• Specific retention requirements for stored account data that defines length of retention period and includes a documented business justification.• Processes for secure deletion or rendering account data unrecoverable when no longer needed per the retention policy.• A process for verifying, at least once every three months, that stored account data exceeding the defined retention period has been securely deleted or rendered unrecoverable.Customized Approach ObjectiveAccount data is retained only where necessary and for the least amount of time needed and is securely deleted or rendered unrecoverable when no longer needed.Applicability NotesWhere account data is stored by a TPSP (for example, in a cloud environment), entities are responsible for working with their service providers to understand how the TPSP meets this requirement for the entity. Considerations include ensuring that all geographic instances of a data element are securely deleted.The bullet above (for coverage of SAD stored prior to completion of authorization) is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 3.2.1 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Defined Approach Testing Procedures3.2.1.a Examine the data retention and disposal policies, procedures, and processes and interview personnel to verify processes are defined to include all elements specified in this requirement.3.2.1.b Examine files and system records on system components where account data is stored to verify that the data storage amount and retention time does not exceed the requirements defined in the data retention policy.3.2.1.c Observe the mechanisms used to render account data unrecoverable to verify data cannot be recovered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | PurposeA formal data retention policy identifies what data needs to be retained, for how long, and where that data resides so it can be securely destroyed or deleted as soon as it is no longer needed. The only account data that may be stored after authorization is the primary account number or PAN (rendered unreadable), expiration date, cardholder name, and service code.The storage of SAD data prior to the completion of the authorization process is also included in the data retention and disposal policy so that storage of this sensitive data is kept to minimum, and only retained for the defined amount of time.Good PracticeWhen identifying locations of stored account data, consider all processes and personnel with access to the data, as data could have been moved and stored in different locations than originally defined. Storage locations that are often overlooked include backup and archive systems, removable data storage devices, paper-based media, and audio recordings.To define appropriate retention requirements, an entity first needs to understand its own business needs as well as any legal or regulatory obligations that apply to its industry or to the type of data being retained. Implementing an automated process to ensure data is automatically and securely deleted upon its defined retention limit can help ensure that account data is not retained beyond what is necessary for business, legal, or regulatory purposes.(continued on next page)Methods of eliminating data when it exceeds the retention period include secure deletion to complete removal of the data or rendering it unrecoverable and unable to be reconstructed. Identifying and securely eliminating stored data that has exceeded its specified retention period prevents unnecessary retention of data that is no longer needed. This process may be automated, manual, or a combination of both.The deletion function in most operating systems is not “secure deletion” as it allows deleted data to be recovered, so instead, a dedicated secure deletion function or application must be used to make data unrecoverable.Remember, if you don't need it, don't store it!ExamplesAn automated, programmatic procedure could be run to locate and remove data, or a manual review of data storage areas could be performed. Whichever method is used, it is a good idea to monitor the process to ensure it is completed successfully, and that the results are recorded and validated as being complete. Implementing secure deletion methods ensures that the data cannot be retrieved when it is no longer needed.Further InformationSee NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 3.3.1     | Defined Approach Requirements3.3.1 SAD is not stored after authorization, even if encrypted. All sensitive authentication data received is rendered unrecoverable upon completion of the authorization process.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Applicability NotesIssuers and companies that support issuing services, where there is a legitimate and documented business need to store SAD, are not required to meet this requirement. A legitimate business need is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided by or for the issuer. Refer to Requirement 3.3.3 for additional requirements specifically for these entities.Sensitive authentication data includes the data cited in Requirements 3.3.1.1 through 3.3.1.3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Defined Approach Testing Procedures3.3.1.a If SAD is received, examine documented policies, procedures, and system configurations to verify the data is not stored after authorization.3.3.1.b If SAD is received, examine the documented procedures and observe the secure data deletion processes to verify the data is rendered unrecoverable upon completion of the authorization process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | PurposeSAD is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Therefore, the storage of SAD upon completion of the authorization process is prohibited.Good PracticeIt may be acceptable for an entity to store SAD in non- persistent memory for a short time after authorization is complete, if following conditions are met:• There is a legitimate business need to access SAD in memory after authorization is complete.• SAD is only ever stored in non-persistent memory (for example, RAM, volatile memory).• Controls are in place to ensure that memory maintains a non-persistent state.• SAD is removed as soon as the business purpose is complete. It is not permissible to store SAD in persistent memory.DefinitionsThe authorization process completes when a merchant receives a transaction response (for example, an approval or decline).Refer to Appendix G for the definition of “authorization.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Each track contains a number of data elements, and this requirement specifies only those that may be retained post-authorization.ExamplesData sources to review to ensure that the full contents of any track are not retained upon completion of the authorization process include, but are not limited to:• Incoming transaction data.• All logs (for example, transaction, history, debugging, error).• History files.• Trace files.• Database schemas.• Contents of databases, and on-premise and cloud data stores.• Any existing memory/crash dump files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Not storing this data reduces the probability of it being compromised.ExamplesIf card verification codes are stored on paper media prior to completion of authorization, a method of erasing or covering the codes should prevent them from being read after authorization is complete. Example methods of rendering the codes unreadable include removing the code with scissors and applying a suitably opaque and un-removable marker over the code.Data sources to review to ensure that the card verification code is not retained upon completion of the authorization process include, but are not limited to:• Incoming transaction data.• All logs (for example, transaction, history, debugging, error).• History files.• Trace files.• Database schemas.• Contents of databases, and on-premise and cloud data stores.• Any existing memory/crash dump files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Contact these organizations for any additional criteria.This requirement applies to all storage of SAD, even if no PAN is present in the environment.Refer to Requirement 3.2.1 for an additional requirement that applies if SAD is stored prior to completion of authorization.Issuers and companies that support issuing services, where there is a legitimate and documented business need to store SAD, are not required to meet this requirement. A legitimate business need is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided by or for the issuer.Refer to Requirement 3.3.3 for requirements specifically for these entities.This requirement does not replace how PIN blocks are required to be managed, nor does it mean that a properly encrypted PIN block needs to be encrypted again.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Defined Approach Testing Procedures3.3.2 Examine data stores, system configurations, and/or vendor documentation to verify that all SAD that is stored electronically prior to completion of authorization is encrypted using strong cryptography.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | PurposeSAD can be used by malicious individuals to increase the probability of successfully generating counterfeit payment cards and creating fraudulent transactions.Good PracticeEntities should consider encrypting SAD with a different cryptographic key than is used to encrypt PAN.

Note that this does not mean that PAN present in SAD (as part of track data) would need to be separately encrypted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 3.4.1     | Defined Approach Requirements3.4.1 PAN is masked when displayed (the BIN and last four digits are the maximum number of digits to be displayed), such that only personnel with a legitimate business need can see more than the BIN and last four digits of the PAN.(continued on next page)Customized Approach ObjectivePAN displays are restricted to the minimum number of digits necessary to meet a defined business need.Applicability NotesThis requirement does not supersede stricter requirements in place for displays of cardholder data— for example, legal or payment brand requirements for point-of-sale (POS) receipts.This requirement relates to protection of PAN where it is displayed on screens, paper receipts, printouts, etc., and is not to be confused with Requirement 3.5.1 for protection of PAN when stored, processed, or transmitted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Defined Approach Testing Procedures3.4.1.a Examine documented policies and procedures for masking the display of PANs to verify:• A list of roles that need access to more than the BIN and last four digits of the PAN (includes full PAN) is documented, together with a legitimate business need for each role to have such access.• PAN is masked when displayed such that only personnel with a legitimate business need can see more than the BIN and last four digits of the PAN.• All roles not specifically authorized to see the full PAN must only see masked PANs.3.4.1.b Examine system configurations to verify that full PAN is only displayed for roles with a documented business need, and that PAN is masked for all other requests.3.4.1.c Examine displays of PAN (for example, on screen, on paper receipts) to verify that PANs are masked when displayed, and that only those with a legitimate business need are able to see more than the BIN and/or last four digits of the PAN.                               | PurposeThe display of full PAN on computer screens, payment card receipts, paper reports, etc. can result in this data being obtained by unauthorized individuals and used fraudulently. Ensuring that the full PAN is displayed only for those with a legitimate business need minimizes the risk of unauthorized persons gaining access to PAN data.Good PracticeApplying access controls according to defined roles is one way to limit access to viewing full PAN to only those individuals with a defined business need.The masking approach should always display only the number of digits needed to perform a specific business function. For example, if only the last four digits are needed to perform a business function, PAN should be masked to only show the last four digits. As another example, if a function needs to view the bank identification number (BIN) for routing purposes, unmask only the BIN digits for that function.(continued on next page)DefinitionsMasking is not synonymous with truncation and these terms cannot be used interchangeably. Masking refers to the concealment of certain digits during display or printing, even when the entire PAN is stored on a system. This is different from truncation, in which the truncated digits are removed and cannot be retrieved within the system. Masked PAN could be “unmasked”, but there is no "un-truncation" without recreating the PAN from another source.Refer to Appendix G for definitions of “masking” and “truncation.”Further InformationFor more information about masking and truncation, see PCI SSC’s FAQs on these topics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3.4.2     | Defined Approach Requirements3.4.2 When using remote-access technologies, technical controls prevent copy and/or relocation of PAN for all personnel, except for those with documented, explicit authorization and a legitimate, defined business need.Customized Approach ObjectivePAN cannot be copied or relocated by unauthorized personnel using remote-access technologies.Applicability NotesStoring or relocating PAN onto local hard drives, removable electronic media, and other storage devices brings these devices into scope for PCI DSS.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Defined Approach Testing Procedures3.4.2.a Examine documented policies and procedures and documented evidence for technical controls that prevent copy and/or relocation of PAN when using remote-access technologies onto local hard drives or removable electronic media to verify the following:• Technical controls prevent all personnel not specifically authorized from copying and/or relocating PAN.• A list of personnel with permission to copy and/or relocate PAN is maintained, together with the documented, explicit authorization and legitimate, defined business need.3.4.2.b Examine configurations for remote-access technologies to verify that technical controls to prevent copy and/or relocation of PAN for all personnel, unless explicitly authorized.3.4.2.c Observe processes and interview personnel to verify that only personnel with documented, explicit authorization and a legitimate, defined business need have permission to copy and/or relocate PAN when using remote- access technologies.     | PurposeRelocation of PAN to unauthorized storage devices is a common way for this data to be obtained and used fraudulently.Methods to ensure that only those with explicit authorization and a legitimate business reason can copy or relocate PAN minimizes the risk of unauthorized persons gaining access to PAN.Good PracticeCopying and relocation of PAN should only be done to storage devices that are permissible and authorized for that individual.DefinitionsA virtual desktop is an example of a remote-access technology. Such remote access technologies often include tools to disable copy and/or relocation functionality.Storage devices include, but are not limited to, local hard drives, virtual drives, removable electronic media, network drives, and cloud storage.Further InformationVendor documentation for the remote-access technology in use will provide information about the system settings needed to implement this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 3.5.1     | Defined Approach Requirements3.5.1 PAN is rendered unreadable anywhere it is stored by using any of the following approaches:• One-way hashes based on strong cryptography of the entire PAN.• Truncation (hashing cannot be used to replace the truncated segment of PAN).– If hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN, or different truncation formats of the same PAN, are present in an environment, additional controls are in place such that the different versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN.• Index tokens.• Strong cryptography with associated key- management processes and procedures.Customized Approach ObjectiveCleartext PAN cannot be read from storage media.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies to PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception, or troubleshooting logs).This requirement does not preclude the use of temporary files containing cleartext PAN while encrypting and decrypting PAN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Defined Approach Testing Procedures3.5.1.a Examine documentation about the system used to render PAN unreadable, including the vendor, type of system/process, and the encryption algorithms (if applicable) to verify that the PAN is rendered unreadable using any of the methods specified in this requirement.3.5.1.b Examine data repositories and audit logs, including payment application logs, to verify the PAN is rendered unreadable using any of the methods specified in this requirement.3.5.1.c If hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in the environment, examine implemented controls to verify that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | PurposeRendering stored PAN unreadable is a defense in depth control designed to protect the data if an unauthorized individual gains access to stored data by taking advantage of a vulnerability or misconfiguration of an entity’s primary access control.Good PracticeIt is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed versions of a PAN. Controls that prevent the correlation of this data will help ensure that the original PAN remains unreadable. Implementing keyed cryptographic hashes with associated key management processes and procedures in accordance with Requirement 3.5.1.1 is a valid additional control to prevent correlation.Further InformationFor information about truncation formats and truncation in general, see PCI SSC’s FAQs on the topic.Sources for information about index tokens include:• PCI SSC’s Tokenization Product Security Guidelines (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/T okenization_Product_Security_Guidelines.pdf)• ANSI X9.119-2-2017: Retail Financial Services - Requirements For Protection Of Sensitive Payment Card Data - Part 2: Implementing Post-Authorization Tokenization Systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3.5.1.1   | Defined Approach Requirements3.5.1.1 Hashes used to render PAN unreadable (per the first bullet of Requirement 3.5.1) are keyed cryptographic hashes of the entire PAN, with associated key- management processes and procedures in accordance with Requirements 3.6 and 3.7.Customized Approach ObjectiveCleartext PAN cannot be determined from hashes of the PAN.Applicability NotesAll Applicability Notes for Requirement 3.5.1 also apply to this requirement.(continued on next page)(continued)Key-management processes and procedures (Requirements 3.6 and 3.7) do not apply to system components used to generate individual keyed hashes of a PAN for comparison to another system if:• The system components only have access to one hash value at a time (hash values are not stored on the system)AND• There is no other account data stored on the same system as the hashes.This requirement is considered a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

Examples of such systems include transaction-originating devices that generate a hash of the PAN for use in a backend system, such as pay-at-gate transit turnstiles. However, in such an implementation, the backend system will have access to more than one hash value at a time, and therefore is required to meet key-management processes and procedures at Requirements 3.6 and 3.7.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 3.5.1.2   | Defined Approach Requirements3.5.1.2 If disk-level or partition-level encryption (rather than file-, column-, or field-level database encryption) is used to render PAN unreadable, it is implemented only as follows:• On removable electronic mediaOR• If used for non-removable electronic media, PAN is also rendered unreadable via another mechanism that meets Requirement 3.5.1.Customized Approach ObjectiveEncrypted PAN is only decrypted when there is a legitimate business need to access that PAN.(continued on next page)Applicability Notes(continued)This requirement applies to any encryption method that provides clear-text PAN automatically when a system runs, even though an authorized user has not specifically requested that data.While disk or partition encryption may still be present on these types of devices, it cannot be the only mechanism used to protect PAN stored on those systems. Any stored PAN must also be rendered unreadable per Requirement 3.5.1—for example, through truncation or a data-level encryption mechanism. Full disk encryption helps to protect data in the event of physical loss of a disk and therefore its use is appropriate only for removable electronic media storage devices.Media that is part of a data center architecture (for example, hot-swappable drives, bulk tape-backups) is considered non-removable electronic media to which Requirement 3.5.1 applies.Disk or partition encryption implementations must also meet all other PCI DSS encryption and key-management requirements.For issuers and companies that support issuing services: This requirement does not apply to PANs being accessed for real-time transaction processing. However, it does apply to PANs stored for other purposes.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.                                                                                                                                                              | Defined Approach Testing Procedures3.5.1.2.a Examine encryption processes to verify that, if disk-level or partition-level encryption is used to render PAN unreadable, it is implemented only as follows:• On removable electronic media,OR• If used for non-removable electronic media, examine encryption processes used to verify that PAN is also rendered unreadable via another method that meets Requirement 3.5.1.3.5.1.2.b Examine configurations and/or vendor documentation and observe encryption processes to verify the system is configured according to vendor documentation the result is that the disk or the partition is rendered unreadable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | PurposeDisk-level and partition-level encryption typically encrypts the entire disk or partition using the same key, with all data automatically decrypted when the system runs or when an authorized user requests it.

This provides no protection from a malicious individual that has already managed to gain access to a valid user account.Good PracticeFull disk encryption helps to protect data in the event of physical loss of a disk and therefore its use is best limited only to removable electronic media storage devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 3.6.1     | Defined Approach Requirements3.6.1 Procedures are defined and implemented to protect cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data against disclosure and misuse that include:• Access to keys is restricted to the fewest number of custodians necessary.• Key-encrypting keys are at least as strong as the data-encrypting keys they protect.• Key-encrypting keys are stored separately from data-encrypting keys.• Keys are stored securely in the fewest possible locations and forms.Customized Approach ObjectiveProcesses that protect cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data against disclosure and misuse are defined and implemented.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies to keys used to protect stored account data and to key-encrypting keys used to protect data-encrypting keys.The requirement to protect keys used to protect stored account data from disclosure and misuse applies to both data-encrypting keys and key- encrypting keys. Because one key-encrypting key may grant access to many data-encrypting keys, the key-encrypting keys require strong protection measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Defined Approach Testing Procedures3.6.1 Examine documented key-management policies and procedures to verify that processes to protect cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data against disclosure and misuse are defined to include all elements specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | PurposeCryptographic keys must be strongly protected because those who obtain access will be able to decrypt data.Good PracticeHaving a centralized key management system based on industry standards is recommended for managing cryptographic keys.Further InformationThe entity’s key management procedures will benefit through alignment with industry requirements, Sources for information on cryptographic key management life cycles include:• ISO 11568-1 Banking — Key management (retail) — Part 1: Principles (specifically Chapter 10 and the referenced Parts 2 &amp;

This allows an entity to keep pace with evolving threats to its architecture and plan for updates as the assurance level provided by different algorithms and key strengths changes. Maintaining such documentation also allows an entity to detect lost or missing keys or key- management devices and identify unauthorized additions to its cryptographic architecture.The use of the same cryptographic keys in both production and test environments introduces a risk of exposing the key if the test environment is not at the same security level as the production environment.Good PracticeHaving an automated reporting mechanism can assist with maintenance of the cryptographic attributes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

visible by unauthorized parties.Good PracticeOnly personnel with defined key custodian responsibilities (creating, altering, rotating, distributing, or otherwise maintaining encryption keys) should be granted access to key components.Ideally this will be a very small number of people.

Cryptoperiods are often defined in terms of the period for which the key is active and/or the amount of cipher- text that has been produced by the key. Considerations for defining the cryptoperiod include, but are not limited to, the strength of the underlying algorithm, size or length of the key, risk of key compromise, and the sensitivity of the data being encrypted.Further InformationNIST SP 800-57 Part 1, Revision 5, Section 5.3 Cryptoperiods – provides guidance for establishing the time span during which a specific key is authorized for use by legitimate entities, or the keys for a given system will remain in effect.

| 3.7.5     | Defined Approach Requirements3.7.5 Key management policies procedures are implemented to include the retirement, replacement, or destruction of keys used to protect stored account data, as deemed necessary when:• The key has reached the end of its defined cryptoperiod.• The integrity of the key has been weakened, including when personnel with knowledge of a cleartext key component leaves the company, or the role for which the key component was known.• The key is suspected of or known to be compromised.Retired or replaced keys are not used for encryption operations.Customized Approach ObjectiveKeys are removed from active use when it is suspected or known that the integrity of the key is weakened.Applicability NotesIf retired or replaced cryptographic keys need to be retained, these keys must be securely archived (for example, by using a key-encryption key).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Defined Approach Testing Procedures3.7.5.a Examine the documented key-management policies and procedures for keys used for protection of stored account data and verify that they define retirement, replacement, or destruction of keys in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.3.7.5.b Interview personnel to verify that processes are implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | PurposeKeys that are no longer required, keys with weakened integrity, and keys that are known or suspected to be compromised, should be archived, revoked, and/or destroyed to ensure that the keys can no longer be used.If such keys need to be kept (for example, to support archived encrypted data), they should be strongly protected.Good PracticeArchived cryptographic keys should be used only for decryption/verification purposes.The encryption solution should provide for and facilitate a process to replace keys that are due for replacement or that are known to be, or suspected of being, compromised. In addition, any keys that are known to be, or suspected of being, compromised should be managed in accordance with the entity’s incident response plan per Requirement 12.10.1.Further InformationIndustry best practices for archiving retired keys are outlined in NIST SP 800-57 Part 1, Revision 5, Section 8.3.1, and includes maintaining the archive with a trusted third party and storing archived key information separately from operational data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

No single person can access or use the authentication factor (for example, the password, PIN, or key) of another.Good PracticeWhere key components or key shares are used, procedures should ensure that no single custodian ever has access to sufficient key components or shares to reconstruct the cryptographic key. For example, in an m-of-n scheme (for example, Shamir), where only two of any three components are required to reconstruct the cryptographic key, a custodian must not have current or prior knowledge of more than one component. If a custodian was previously assigned component A, which was then reassigned, the custodian should not then be assigned component B or C, as this would give the custodian knowledge of two components and the ability to recreate the key.(continued on next page)ExamplesKey-management operations that might be performed manually include, but are not limited to, key generation, transmission, loading, storage, and destruction.Further InformationIndustry standards for managing key components include:• NIST SP 800-57 Part 2, Revision 1 -- Recommendation for Key Management: Part 2 – Best Practices for Key Management Organizations [4.6 Keying Material Distribution]• ISO 11568-2 Banking — Key management (retail) — Part 2: Symmetric ciphers, their key management and life cycle [4.7.2.3 Key components and 4.9.3 Key components]• European Payments Council EPC342-08 Guidelines on Cryptographic Algorithms Usage and Key Management [especially 4.1.4 Key installation].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

To protect against compromise, PAN must be encrypted during transmission over networks that are easily accessed by malicious individuals, including untrusted and public networks. Misconfigured wireless networks and vulnerabilities in legacy encryption and authentication protocols continue to be targeted by malicious individuals aiming to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to cardholder data environments (CDE). Any transmissions of cardholder data over an entity’s internal network(s) will naturally bring that network into scope for PCI DSS since that network stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data. Any such networks must be evaluated and assessed against applicable PCI DSS requirements. Requirement 4 applies to transmissions of PAN unless specifically called out in an individual requirement. PAN transmissions can be protected by encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by encrypting the session over which the data is transmitted, or both. While it is not required that strong cryptography be applied at both the data level and the session level, it is recommended.

While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 4, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives. Policies and procedures, including updates, are actively communicated to all affected personnel, and are supported by operating procedures describing how to perform activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

formally assigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities may not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix).

| 4.2.1     | Defined Approach Requirements4.2.1 Strong cryptography and security protocols are implemented as follows to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks:• Only trusted keys and certificates are accepted.• Certificates used to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks are confirmed as valid and are not expired or revoked. This bullet is a best practice until its effective date; refer to applicability notes below for details.• The protocol in use supports only secure versions or configurations and does not support fallback to, or use of insecure versions, algorithms, key sizes, or implementations.• The encryption strength is appropriate for the encryption methodology in use.Customized Approach ObjectiveCleartext PAN cannot be read or intercepted from any transmissions over open, public networks.Applicability NotesA self-signed certificate may also be acceptable if the certificate is issued by an internal CA within the organization, the certificate’s author is confirmed, and the certificate is verified—for example, via hash or signature—and has not expired.The bullet above (for confirming that certificates used to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks are valid and are not expired or revoked) is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 4.2.1 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.4.2.1 (continued)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Defined Approach Testing Procedures4.2.1.a Examine documented policies and procedures and interview personnel to verify processes are defined to include all elements specified in this requirement.4.2.1.b Examine system configurations to verify that strong cryptography and security protocols are implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.4.2.1.c Examine cardholder data transmissions to verify that all PAN is encrypted with strong cryptography when it is transmitted over open, public networks.4.2.1.d Examine system configurations to verify that keys and/or certificates that cannot be verified as trusted are rejected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | PurposeSensitive information must be encrypted during transmission over public networks because it is easy and common for a malicious individual to intercept and/or divert data while in transit.Good PracticeThe network and data-flow diagrams defined in Requirement 1 are useful resources for identifying all connection points where account data is transmitted or received over open, public networks.While not required, it is considered a good practice for entities to also encrypt PAN over their internal networks, and for entities to establish any new network implementations with encrypted communications.PAN transmissions can be protected by encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by encrypting the session over which the data is transmitted, or both. While it is not required that strong cryptography be applied at both the data level and the session level, it is strongly recommended. If encrypted at the data level, the cryptographic keys used for protecting the data can be managed in accordance with Requirements 3.6 and 3.7. If the data is encrypted at the session level, designated key custodians should be assigned responsibility for managing transmission keys and certificates.(continued on next page)Some protocol implementations (such as SSL, SSH v1.0, and early TLS) have known vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain access to the cleartext data. It is critical that entities maintain awareness of industry-defined deprecation dates for the cipher suites they are using and are prepared to migrate to newer versions or protocols when older ones are no longer deemed secure.Verifying that certificates are trusted helps ensure the integrity of the secure connection. To be considered trusted, a certificate should be issued from a trusted source, such as a trusted certificate authority (CA), and not be expired. Up-to-date Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) can be used to validate certificates.Techniques to validate certificates may include certificate and public key pinning, where the trusted certificate or a public key is pinned either during development or upon its first use. Entities can also confirm with developers or review source code to ensure that clients and servers reject connections if the certificate is bad.For browser-based TLS certificates, certificate trust can often be verified by clicking on the lock icon that appears next to the address bar.(continued on next page)ExamplesOpen, public networks include, but are not limited to:• The Internet and• Wireless technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular technologies, and satellite communications.Further InformationVendor recommendations and industry best practices can be consulted for information about the proper encryption strength specific to the encryption methodology in use.For more information about strong cryptography and secure protocols, see industry standards and best practices such as NIST SP 800-52 and SP 800-57.For more information about trusted keys and certificates, see NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide Special Publication 1800-16, Securing Web Transactions: Transport Layer Security (TLS) Server Certificate Management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Malicious users use free and widely available tools to eavesdrop on wireless communications. Use of strong cryptography can help limit disclosure of sensitive information across wireless networks.Wireless networks present unique risks to an organization; therefore, they must be identified and protected according to industry requirements. Strong cryptography for authentication and transmission of PAN is required to prevent malicious users from gaining access to the wireless network or utilizing wireless networks to access other internal networks or data.Good PracticeWireless networks should not permit fallback or downgrade to an insecure protocol or lower encryption strength that does not meet the intent of strong cryptography.Further InformationReview the vendor’s specific documentation for more details on the choice of protocols, configurations, and settings related to cryptography.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 4.2.2     | Defined Approach Requirements4.2.2 PAN is secured with strong cryptography whenever it is sent via end-user messaging technologies.Customized Approach ObjectiveCleartext PAN cannot be read or intercepted from transmissions using end-user messaging technologies.Applicability NotesThis requirement also applies if a customer, or other third party, requests that PAN is sent to them via end-user messaging technologies.There could be occurrences where an entity receives unsolicited cardholder data via an insecure communication channel that was not intended for transmissions of sensitive data. In this situation, the entity can choose to either include the channel in the scope of their CDE and secure it according to PCI DSS or delete the cardholder data and implement measures to prevent the channel from being used for cardholder data.Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program

Examples include viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, ransomware, keyloggers, rootkits, malicious code, scripts, and links. Malware can enter the network during many business-approved activities, including employee e-mail (for example, via phishing) and use of the Internet, mobile computers, and storage devices, resulting in the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Using anti-malware solutions that address all types of malware helps to protect systems from current and evolving malware threats.

While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 5, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Without an anti- malware solution that is updated regularly, new forms of malware can be used to attack systems, disable a network, or compromise data.Good PracticeIt is beneficial for entities to be aware of "zero-day" attacks (those that exploit a previously unknown vulnerability) and consider solutions that focus on behavioral characteristics and will alert and react to unexpected behavior.DefinitionsSystem components known to be affected by malware have active malware exploits available in the real world (not only theoretical exploits).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

However, industry trends for malware can change quickly, so it is important for organizations to be aware of new malware that might affect their systems—for example, by monitoring vendor security notices and anti-malware forums to determine whether its systems might be coming under threat from new and evolving malware.Good PracticeIf an entity determines that a particular system is not susceptible to any malware, the determination should be supported by industry evidence, vendor resources, and best practices.The following steps can help entities during their periodic evaluations:• Identification of all system types previously determined to not require malware protection.• Review of industry vulnerability alerts and notices to determine if new threats exist for any identified system.• A documented conclusion about whether the system types remain not susceptible to malware.• A strategy to add malware protection for any system types for which malware protection has become necessary.Trends in malware should be included in the identification of new security vulnerabilities at Requirement 6.3.1, and methods to address new trends should be incorporated into the entity’s configuration standards and protection mechanisms as needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Using a trusted common source to distribute updates to end-user systems helps ensure the integrity and consistency of the solution architecture.Updates may be automatically downloaded to a central location—for example, to allow for testing— prior to being deployed to individual system components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Some malware, such as zero-day malware, can enter an environment before the scan solution is capable of detecting it. Performing regular periodic scans or continuous behavioral analysis of systems or processes helps ensure that previously undetectable malware can be identified, removed, and investigated to determine how it gained access to the environment.Good PracticeUsing a combination of periodic scans (scheduled and on-demand) and active, real-time (on-access) scanning helps ensure that malware residing in both static and dynamic elements of the CDE is addressed. Users should also be able to run on- demand scans on their systems if suspicious activity is detected – this can be useful in the early detection of malware.Scans should include the entire file system, including all disks, memory, and start-up files and boot records (at system restart) to detect all malware upon file execution, including any software that may be resident on a system but not currently active. Scan scope should include all systems and software in the CDE, including those that are often overlooked such as email servers, web browsers, and instant messaging software.DefinitionsActive, or real-time, scanning checks files for malware upon any attempt to open, close, rename, or otherwise interact with a file, preventing the malware from being activated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Additional security measures may also need to be implemented for the period during which anti-malware protection is not active.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Defined Approach Testing Procedures5.3.5.a Examine anti-malware configurations, to verify that the anti-malware mechanisms cannot be disabled or altered by users.5.3.5.b Interview responsible personnel and observe processes to verify that any requests to disable or alter anti-malware mechanisms are specifically documented and authorized by management on a case-by-case basis for a limited time period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | PurposeIt is important that defensive mechanisms are always running so that malware is detected in real time. Ad-hoc starting and stopping of anti-malware solutions could allow malware to propagate unchecked and undetected.Good PracticeWhere there is a legitimate need to temporarily disable a system’s anti-malware protection—for example, to support a specific maintenance activity or investigation of a technical problem—the reason for taking such action should be understood and approved by an appropriate management representative. Any disabling or altering of anti- malware mechanisms, including on administrators’ own devices, should be performed by authorized personnel. It is recognized that administrators have privileges that may allow them to disable anti- malware on their own computers, but there should be alerting mechanisms in place when such software is disabled and then follow up that occurs to ensure correct processes were followed.ExamplesAdditional security measures that may need to be implemented for the period during which anti- malware protection is not active include disconnecting the unprotected system from the Internet while the anti-malware protection is disabled and running a full scan once it is re- enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Meeting this requirement does not also meet the requirement for providing personnel with security awareness training, and vice versa.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.5.4.1 (continued)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Defined Approach Testing Procedures5.4.1 Observe implemented processes and examine mechanisms to verify controls are in place to detect and protect personnel against phishing attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | PurposeTechnical controls can limit the number of occasions personnel have to evaluate the veracity of a communication and can also limit the effects of individual responses to phishing.Good PracticeWhen developing anti-phishing controls, entities are encouraged to consider a combination of approaches. For example, using anti-spoofing controls such as Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance (DMARC), Sender Policy Framework (SPF), and Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) will help stop phishers from spoofing the entity’s domain and impersonating personnel.The deployment of technologies for blocking phishing emails and malware before they reach personnel, such as link scrubbers and server-side anti-malware, can reduce incidents and decrease the time required by personnel to check and report phishing attacks. Additionally, training personnel to recognize and report phishing emails can allow similar emails to be identified and permit them to be removed before being opened.It is recommended (but not required) that anti- phishing controls are applied across an entity’s entire organization.(continued on next page)DefinitionsPhishing is a form of social engineering and describes the different methods used by attackers to trick personnel into disclosing sensitive information, such as user account names and passwords, and account data. Attackers will typically disguise themselves and attempt to appear as a genuine or trusted source, directing personnel to send an email response, click on a web link, or enter data into a compromised website. Mechanisms that can detect and prevent phishing attempts are often included in anti-malware solutions.Further InformationSee the following for more information about phishing:National Cyber Security Centre - Phishing Attacks: Defending your Organization.US Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency - Report Phishing Sites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Many of these vulnerabilities are fixed by vendor provided security patches, which must be installed by the entities that manage the systems. All system components must have all appropriate software patches to protect against the exploitation and compromise of account data by malicious individuals and malicious software. Appropriate software patches are those patches that have been evaluated and tested sufficiently to determine that the patches do not conflict with existing security configurations. For bespoke and custom software, numerous vulnerabilities can be avoided by applying software lifecycle (SLC) processes and secure coding techniques. Code repositories that store application code, system configurations, or other configuration data that can impact the security of cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data are in scope for PCI DSS assessments. See Relationship between PCI DSS and PCI SSC Software Standards on page 7 for information about the use of PCI SSC-validated software and software vendors, and how use of PCI SSC’s software standards may help with meeting controls in Requirement 6. Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms. Note: Requirement 6 applies to all system components, except for section 6.2 for developing software securely, which applies only to bespoke and custom software used on any system component included in or connected to the CDE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 6, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

formally assigned, systems will not be securely maintained, and their security level will be reduced.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix).

requirements definition, design, analysis, and testing phases of software development, security vulnerabilities can be inadvertently or maliciously introduced into the production environment.Good PracticeUnderstanding how sensitive data is handled by the application—including when stored, transmitted, and in memory—can help identify where data needs to be protected.PCI DSS requirements must be considered when developing software to meet those requirements by design, rather than trying to retrofit the software later.ExamplesSecure software lifecycle management methodologies and frameworks include PCI Software Security Framework, BSIMM, OPENSAMM, and works from NIST, ISO, and SAFECode.

| 6.2.3     | Defined Approach Requirements6.2.3 Bespoke and custom software is reviewed prior to being released into production or to customers, to identify and correct potential coding vulnerabilities, as follows:• Code reviews ensure code is developed according to secure coding guidelines.• Code reviews look for both existing and emerging software vulnerabilities.• Appropriate corrections are implemented prior to release.Customized Approach ObjectiveBespoke and custom software cannot be exploited via coding vulnerabilities.Applicability NotesThis requirement for code reviews applies to all bespoke and custom software (both internal and public facing), as part of the system development lifecycle.Public-facing web applications are also subject to additional controls, to address ongoing threats and vulnerabilities after implementation, as defined at PCI DSS Requirement 6.4.Code reviews may be performed using either manual or automated processes, or a combination of both.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Defined Approach Testing Procedures6.2.3.a Examine documented software development procedures and interview responsible personnel to verify that processes are defined that require all bespoke and custom software to be reviewed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.6.2.3.b Examine evidence of changes to bespoke and custom software to verify that the code changes were reviewed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | PurposeSecurity vulnerabilities in bespoke and custom software are commonly exploited by malicious individuals to gain access to a network and compromise account data.Vulnerable code is far more difficult and expensive to address after it has been deployed or released into production environments. Requiring a formal review and signoff by management prior to release helps to ensure that code is approved and has been developed in accordance with policies and procedures.Good PracticeThe following items should be considered for inclusion in code reviews:• Searching for undocumented features (implant tools, backdoors).• Confirming that software securely uses external components’ functions (libraries, frameworks, APIs, etc.).

Requiring management approval that the code was reviewed limits the ability for the process to be bypassed.Good PracticeHaving a formal review methodology and review checklists has been found to improve the quality of the code review process.Code review is a tiring process, and for this reason, it is most effective when reviewers only review small amounts of code at a time.To maintain the effectiveness of code reviews, it is beneficial to monitor the general workload of reviewers and to have them review applications they are familiar with.Code reviews may be performed using either manual or automated processes, or a combination of both.Entitles that rely solely on manual code review should ensure that reviewers maintain their skills through regular training as new vulnerabilities are found, and new secure coding methods are recommended.Further InformationSee the OWASP Code Review Guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 6.2.4     | Defined Approach Requirements6.2.4 Software engineering techniques or other methods are defined and in use by software development personnel to prevent or mitigate common software attacks and related vulnerabilities in bespoke and custom software, including but not limited to the following: • Injection attacks, including SQL, LDAP, XPath, or other command, parameter, object, fault, or injection-type flaws. • Attacks on data and data structures, including attempts to manipulate buffers, pointers, input data, or shared data.• Attacks on cryptography usage, including attempts to exploit weak, insecure, or inappropriate cryptographic implementations, algorithms, cipher suites, or modes of operation. • Attacks on business logic, including attempts to abuse or bypass application features and functionalities through the manipulation of APIs, communication protocols and channels, client- side functionality, or other system/application functions and resources. This includes cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). • Attacks on access control mechanisms, including attempts to bypass or abuse identification, authentication, or authorization mechanisms, or attempts to exploit weaknesses in the implementation of such mechanisms. • Attacks via any “high-risk” vulnerabilities identified in the vulnerability identification process, as defined in Requirement 6.3.1.Customized Approach ObjectiveBespoke and custom software cannot be exploited via common attacks and related vulnerabilities.Applicability NotesThis applies to all software developed for or by the entity for the entity’s own use.

Having formal engineering techniques and tools embedded in the development process will catch these errors early. This philosophy is sometimes called “shifting security left.” Good PracticeFor both bespoke and custom software, the entity must ensure that code is developed focusing on the prevention or mitigation of common software attacks, including: • Attempts to exploit common coding vulnerabilities (bugs). • Attempts to exploit software design flaws. • Attempts to exploit implementation/configuration flaws. • Enumeration attacks – automated attacks that are actively exploited in payments and abuse identification, authentication, or authorization mechanisms. See the PCI Perspectives blog article “Beware of Account Testing Attacks.” (continued on next page)Researching and documenting software engineering techniques or other methods helps to define how software developers prevent or mitigate various software attacks by features or countermeasures they build into software. This might include identification/authentication mechanisms, access control, input validation routines, etc. Developers should be familiar with different types of vulnerabilities and potential attacks and use measures to avoid potential attack vectors when developing code.ExamplesTechniques include automated processes and practices that scan code early in the development cycle when code is checked in to confirm the vulnerabilities are not present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered “critical” if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed. Examples of critical systems may include security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data.(continued on next page)An organization’s processes for managing vulnerabilities should be integrated with other management processes—for example, risk management, change management, patch management, incident response, application security, as well as proper monitoring and logging of these processes. This process should include multiple sources of vulnerability information, including industry-recognized vulnerability databases (for example, the US National Vulnerability Database), CERTs, RSS feeds, information received from vendors and third parties, and vulnerabilities identified via internal and external vulnerability scans (Requirements 11.3.1 and 11.3.2). This will help to ensure all vulnerabilities are properly identified and addressed. Processes should support ongoing evaluation of vulnerabilities. For example, a vulnerability initially identified as low risk could become a higher risk later. Additionally, vulnerabilities individually considered to be low or medium risk, could collectively pose a high or critical risk if present on the same system, or if exploited on a low-risk system that could result in access to the CDE.(continued on next page)ExamplesSome organizations that issue alerts to advise entities about urgent vulnerabilities requiring immediate patches/updates are national Computer Emergency Readiness/Response Teams (CERTs) and vendors.Criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include criticality of a vulnerability identified in an alert from Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) or a CERT, consideration of the CVSS score, the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected.Further InformationTrustworthy sources for vulnerability information include vendor websites, industry newsgroups, mailing lists, etc. If software is developed in-house, the internal development team should also consider sources of information about new vulnerabilities that may affect internally developed applications. Other methods to ensure new vulnerabilities are identified include solutions that automatically recognize and alert upon detection of unusual behavior. Processes should account for widely published exploits as well as “zero-day” attacks, which target previously unknown vulnerabilities.For bespoke and custom software, the organization may obtain information about libraries, frameworks, compilers, programming languages, etc. from public trusted sources (for example, special resources and resources from component developers). The organization may also independently analyze third- party components and identify vulnerabilities.(continued on next page)For control over in-house developed software, the organization may receive such information from external sources. The organization can consider using a “bug bounty” program where it posts information (for example, on its website) so third parties can contact the organization with vulnerability information.

If the most recent security patches/updates are not implemented on critical systems as soon as possible, a malicious actor can use these exploits to attack or disable a system or gain access to sensitive data.Good PracticePrioritizing security patches/updates for critical infrastructure ensures that high-priority systems and devices are protected from vulnerabilities as soon as possible after a patch is released.An entity’s patching cadence should factor in any re- evaluation of vulnerabilities and subsequent changes in the criticality of a vulnerability per Requirement 6.3.1. For example, a vulnerability initially identified as low risk could become a higher risk later. Additionally, vulnerabilities individually considered to be low or medium risk could collectively pose a high or critical risk if present on the same system, or if exploited on a low-risk system that could result in access to the CDE.(continued on next page)It is recommended that the entity complete a targeted risk analysis (TRA) according to PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.1 to document the frequency of installing all other applicable security patches/updates. This TRA would include consideration of the entity’s assessment of the criticality of the risk to their environment as identified in the risk ranking process at Requirement 6.3.1.ExamplesAn example time frame for installation of patches/updates could be 60 days for high-risk vulnerabilities and 90 days for others, as determined by the entity’s assessment of risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 6.4.1     | Defined Approach Requirements6.4.1 For public-facing web applications, new threats and vulnerabilities are addressed on an ongoing basis and these applications are protected against known attacks as follows:• Reviewing public-facing web applications via manual or automated application vulnerability security assessment tools or methods as follows: – At least once every 12 months and after significant changes. – By an entity that specializes in application security. – Including, at a minimum, all common software attacks in Requirement 6.2.4. – All vulnerabilities are ranked in accordance with requirement 6.3.1. – All vulnerabilities are corrected. – The application is re-evaluated after the corrections. OR • Installing an automated technical solution(s) that continually detects and prevents web-based attacks as follows:– Installed in front of public-facing web applications to detect and prevent web- based attacks. – Actively running and up to date as applicable. – Generating audit logs. – Configured to either block web-based attacks or generate an alert that is immediately investigated.Customized Approach ObjectivePublic-facing web applications are protected against malicious attacks.Applicability NotesThis assessment is not the same as the vulnerability scans performed for Requirement 11.3.1 and 11.3.2.This requirement will be superseded by Requirement 6.4.2 after 31 March 2025 when Requirement 6.4.2 becomes effective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Defined Approach Testing Procedures6.4.1 For public-facing web applications, ensure that either one of the required methods is in place as follows:• If manual or automated vulnerability security assessment tools or methods are in use, examine documented processes, interview personnel, and examine records of application security assessments to verify that public- facing web applications are reviewed in accordance with all elements of this requirement specific to the tool/method.OR• If an automated technical solution(s) is installed that continually detects and prevents web- based attacks, examine the system configuration settings and audit logs, and interview responsible personnel to verify that the automated technical solution(s) is installed in accordance with all elements of this requirement specific to the solution(s).                                                                                                                                                                         | Purpose Public-facing web applications are those that are available to the public (not only for internal use). These applications are primary targets for attackers, and poorly coded web applications provide an easy path for attackers to gain access to sensitive data and systems.Good Practice Manual or automated vulnerability security assessment tools or methods review and/or test the application for vulnerabilities.Common assessment tools include specialized web scanners that perform automatic analysis of web application protection.When using automated technical solutions, it is important to include processes that facilitate timely responses to alerts generated by the solutions so that any detected attacks can be mitigated.Examples A web application firewall (WAF) installed in front of public-facing web applications to check all traffic is an example of an automated technical solution that detects and prevents web-based attacks (for example, the attacks included in Requirement 6.2.4). WAFs filter and block non-essential traffic at the application layer. A properly configured WAF helps to prevent application-layer attacks on applications that are improperly coded or configured.(continued on next page)Another example of an automated technical solution is Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) technologies. When implemented correctly, RASP solutions can detect and block anomalous behavior by the software during execution. While WAFs typically monitor the application perimeter, RASP solutions monitor and block behavior within the application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Such solutions may also be used to automate mitigation, for example rate-limiting controls, which can be implemented to mitigate against brute-force attacks and enumeration attacks.ExamplesA web application firewall (WAF), which can be either on-premise or cloud-based, installed in front of public-facing web applications to check all traffic, is an example of an automated technical solution that detects and prevents web-based attacks (for example, the attacks included in Requirement 6.2.4). WAFs filter and block non-essential traffic at the application layer. A properly configured WAF helps to prevent application-layer attacks on applications that are improperly coded or configured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 6.4.3     | Defined Approach Requirements6.4.3 All payment page scripts that are loaded and executed in the consumer’s browser are managed as follows:• A method is implemented to confirm that each script is authorized.• A method is implemented to assure the integrity of each script.• An inventory of all scripts is maintained with written business or technical justification as to why each is necessary.Customized Approach ObjectiveUnauthorized code cannot be executed in the payment page as it is rendered in the consumer’s browser.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies to all scripts loaded from the entity’s environment and scripts loaded from third and fourth parties.This requirement also applies to scripts in the entity’s webpage(s) that includes a TPSP’s/ payment processor’s embedded payment page/form (for example, one or more inline frames or iframes).This requirement does not apply to an entity for scripts in a TPSP’s/payment processor’s embedded payment page/form (for example, one or more iframes), where the entity includes a TPSP’s/payment processor’s payment page/form on its webpage.Scripts in the TPSP’s/payment processor’s embedded payment page/form are the responsibility of the TPSP/payment processor to manage in accordance with this requirement.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Defined Approach Testing Procedures6.4.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verify that processes are defined for managing all payment page scripts that are loaded and executed in the consumer’s browser, in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.6.4.3.b Interview responsible personnel and examine inventory records and system configurations to verify that all payment page scripts that are loaded and executed in the consumer’s browser are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | PurposeScripts loaded and executed in the payment page can have their functionality altered without the entity’s knowledge and can also have the functionality to load additional external scripts (for example, advertising and tracking, tag management systems).Such seemingly harmless scripts can be used by potential attackers to upload malicious scripts that can read and exfiltrate cardholder data from the consumer browser.Ensuring that the functionality of all such scripts is understood to be necessary for the operation of the payment page minimizes the number of scripts that could be tampered with.Ensuring that scripts have been explicitly authorized reduces the probability of unnecessary scripts being added to the payment page without appropriate management approval. Where it is impractical for such authorization to occur before a script is changed or a new script is added to the page, the authorization should be confirmed as soon as possible after a change is made.Using techniques to prevent tampering with the script will minimize the probability of the script being modified to carry out unauthorized behavior, such as skimming the cardholder data from the payment page.(continued on next page)Good PracticeScripts may be authorized by manual or automated (e.g., workflow) processes.Where the payment page will be loaded into an inline frame (iframe), restricting the location that the payment page can be loaded from, using the parent page’s Content Security Policy (CSP) can help prevent unauthorized content being substituted for the payment page.Where an entity includes a TPSP’s/payment processor’s embedded payment page/form on its webpage, the entity should expect the TPSP/payment processor to provide evidence that the TPSP/payment processor is meeting this requirement, in accordance with the TPSP’s/payment processor’s PCI DSS assessment and Requirement 12.9.ExamplesThe integrity of scripts can be enforced by several different mechanisms including, but not limited to:• Sub-resource integrity (SRI), which allows the consumer browser to validate that a script has not been tampered with. • A CSP, which limits the locations the consumer browser can load a script from and transmit account data to. • Proprietary script or tag-management systems, which can prevent malicious script execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

For each change examined, verify the change is implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | PurposeChange management procedures must be applied to all changes—including the addition, removal, or modification of any system component—in the production environment. It is important to document the reason for a change and the change description so that relevant parties understand and agree the change is needed. Likewise, documenting the impacts of the change allows all affected parties to plan appropriately for any processing changes.Good PracticeApproval by authorized parties confirms that the change is legitimate and that the change is sanctioned by the organization. Changes should be approved by individuals with the appropriate authority and knowledge to understand the impact of the change.Thorough testing by the entity confirms that the security of the environment is not reduced by implementing a change and that all existing security controls either remain in place or are replaced with equal or stronger security controls after the change. The specific testing to be performed will vary according to the type of change and system component(s) affected.For each change, it is important to have documented procedures that address any failures and provide instructions on how to return to a secure state in case the change fails or adversely affects the security of an application or system. These procedures will allow the application or system to be restored to its previous secure state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

processes helps ensure that device inventories and configuration standards are kept up to date and security controls are applied where needed.ExamplesApplicable PCI DSS requirements that could be impacted include, but are not limited to:• Network and data-flow diagrams are updated to reflect changes. • Systems are configured per configuration standards, with all default passwords changed and

PracticeOrganizations must clearly understand which environments are test environments or development environments and how these environments interact on the level of networks and applications.DefinitionsPre-production environments include development, testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), etc. Even where production infrastructure is used to facilitate testing or development, production environments still need to be separated (logically or physically) from pre-production functionality such that vulnerabilities introduced as a result of pre-production activities do not adversely affect production systems.

| 6.5.4     | Defined Approach Requirements6.5.4 Roles and functions are separated between production and pre-production environments to provide accountability such that only reviewed and approved changes are deployed.Customized Approach ObjectiveJob roles and accountability that differentiate between pre-production and production activities are defined and managed to minimize the risk of unauthorized, unintentional, or inappropriate actions.Applicability NotesIn environments with limited personnel where individuals perform multiple roles or functions, this same goal can be achieved with additional procedural controls that provide accountability. For example, a developer may also be an administrator that uses an administrator-level account with elevated privileges in the development environment and, for their developer role, they use a separate account with user-level access to the production environment.

   | PurposeThe goal of separating roles and functions between production and pre-production environments is to reduce the number of personnel with access to the production environment and account data and thereby minimize risk of unauthorized, unintentional, or inappropriate access to data and system components and help ensure that access is limited to those individuals with a business need for such access.The intent of this control is to separate critical activities to provide oversight and review to catch errors and minimize the chances of fraud or theft (since two people would need to collude in order to hide an activity).Separating roles and functions, also referred to as separation or segregation of duties, is a key internal control concept to protect an entity’s assets.

Additionally, when payment cards expire, the same PAN is often reused with a different expiry date. All PANs must be verified as being unable to conduct payment transactions or pose fraud risk to the payment system before they are excluded from PCI DSS scope. It is the responsibility of the entity to confirm that PANs are not live.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

To ensure critical data can only be accessed by authorized personnel, systems and processes must be in place to limit access based on need to know and according to job responsibilities. “Access” or “access rights” are created by rules that provide users access to systems, applications, and data, while “privileges” allow a user to perform a specific action or function in relation to that system, application, or data. For example, a user may have access rights to specific data, but whether they can only read that data, or can also change or delete the data is determined by the user’s assigned privileges. “Need to know” refers to providing access to only the least amount of data needed to perform a job. “Least privileges” refers to providing only the minimum level of privileges needed to perform a job. These requirements apply to user accounts and access for employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors and other third parties (for example, for providing support or maintenance services). Certain requirements also apply to application and system accounts used by the entity (also called “service accounts”). These requirements do not apply to consumers (cardholders).

While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 7, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

formally assigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities, and critical activities may not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed

This principle is intended to prevent fraud and misuse or theft of resources. For example, 1) dividing mission- critical functions and information system support functions among different individuals and/or functions, 2) establishing roles such that information system support activities are performed by different functions/individuals (for example, system management, programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, and network security), and 3) ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions.In environments where one individual performs multiple functions, such as administration and security operations, duties may be assigned so that no single individual has end-to-end control of a process without an independent checkpoint. For example, responsibility for configuration and responsibility for approving changes could be assigned to separate individuals.(continued on next page)DefinitionsKey elements of an access control model include:• Resources to be protected (the systems/devices/data to which access is needed),• Job functions that need access to the resource (for example, system administrator, call-center personnel, store clerk), and• Which activities each job function needs to perform (for example, read/write or query).Once job functions, resources, and activities per job functions are defined, individuals can be granted access accordingly.ExamplesAccess control models that entities can consider include role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC). The access control model used by a given entity depends on their business and access needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Enforcing least privilege also helps to minimize the scope of damage if an unauthorized person gains access to a user ID.Good PracticeAccess rights are granted to a user by assignment to one or several functions. Access is assigned depending on the specific user functions and with the minimum scope required for the job.When assigning privileged access, it is important to assign individuals only the privileges they need to perform their job (the “least privileges”). For example, the database administrator or backup administrator should not be assigned the same privileges as the overall systems administrator.Once needs are defined for user functions (per PCI DSS requirement 7.2.1), it is easy to grant individuals access according to their job classification and function by using the already- created roles.Entities may wish to consider use of Privileged Access Management (PAM), which is a method to grant access to privileged accounts only when those privileges are required, immediately revoking that access once they are no longer needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 7.2.4     | Defined Approach Requirements7.2.4 All user accounts and related access privileges, including third-party/vendor accounts, are reviewed as follows:• At least once every six months.• To ensure user accounts and access remain appropriate based on job function.• Any inappropriate access is addressed.• Management acknowledges that access remains appropriate.Customized Approach ObjectiveAccount privilege assignments are verified periodically by management as correct, and nonconformities are remediated.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies to all user accounts and related access privileges, including those used by personnel and third parties/vendors, and accounts used to access third-party cloud services.See Requirements 7.2.5 and 7.2.5.1 and 8.6.1 through 8.6.3 for controls for application and system accounts.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Defined Approach Testing Procedures7.2.4.a Examine policies and procedures to verify they define processes to review all user accounts and related access privileges, including third- party/vendor accounts, in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.7.2.4.b Interview responsible personnel and examine documented results of periodic reviews of user accounts to verify that all the results are in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Purpose Regular review of access rights helps to detect excessive access rights remaining after user job responsibilities change, system functions change, or other modifications. If excessive user rights are not revoked in due time, they may be used by malicious users for unauthorized access.This review provides another opportunity to ensure that accounts for all terminated users have been removed (if any were missed at the time of termination), as well as to ensure that any third parties that no longer need access have had their access terminated.Good Practice When a user transfers into a new role or a new department, typically the privileges and access associated with their former role are no longer required. Continued access to privileges or functions that are no longer required may introduce the risk of misuse or errors. Therefore, when responsibilities change, processes that revalidate access help to ensure user access is appropriate for the user’s new responsibilities.Entities can consider implementing a regular, repeatable process for conducting reviews of access rights, and assigning “data owners” that are responsible for managing and monitoring access to data related to their job function and that also ensure user access remains current and appropriate. As an example, a direct manager could review team access monthly, while the senior manager reviews their groups’ access quarterly, both making updates to access as needed. The intent of these best practices is to support and facilitate conducting the reviews at least once every 6 months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Therefore, it is important to ensure limited access is granted to system and application accounts on the same basis as to user accounts.Good PracticeEntities may want to consider establishing a baseline when setting up these application and system accounts including the following as applicable to the organization:• Making sure that the account is not a member of a privileged group such as domain administrators, local administrators, or root.• Restricting which computers the account can be used on.• Restricting hours of use.• Removing any additional settings like VPN access and remote access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Limiting such access to administrators reduces the risk of such access being abused by unauthorized users.Definitions“Programmatic methods” means granting access through means such as database stored procedures that allow users to perform controlled actions to data in a table, rather than via direct, unfiltered access to the data repository by end users (except for the responsible administrator(s), who need direct access to the database for their administrative duties).Good PracticeTypical user actions include moving, copying, and deleting data. Also consider the scope of privilege needed when granting access. For example, access can be granted to specific objects such as data elements, files, tables, indexes, views, and stored routines. Granting access to repositories of cardholder data should follow the same process as all other granted access, meaning that it is based on roles, with only the privileges assigned to each user that are needed to perform their job functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

                            | PurposeA default setting of “deny all” ensures no one is granted access unless a rule is established specifically granting such access.Good PracticeIt is important to check the default configuration of access control systems because some are set by default to “allow all,” thereby permitting access unless/until a rule is written to specifically deny it.

Identification of an individual or process on a computer system is conducted by associating an identity with a person or process through an identifier, such as a user, system, or application ID. These IDs (also referred to as “accounts”) fundamentally establish the identity of an individual or process by assigning unique identification to each person or process to distinguish one user or process from another. When each user or process can be uniquely identified, it ensures there is accountability for actions performed by that identity. When such accountability is in place, actions taken can be traced to known and authorized users and processes. The element used to prove or verify the identity is known as the authentication factor. Authentication factors are 1) something you know, such as a password or passphrase, 2) something you have, such as a token device or smart card, or 3) something you are, such as a biometric element. The ID and the authentication factor together are considered authentication credentials and are used to gain access to the rights and privileges associated with a user, application, system, or service accounts. These requirements for identity and authentication are based on industry-accepted security principles and best practices to support the payment ecosystem. NIST Special Publication 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines provides additional information on acceptable frameworks for digital identity and authentication factors. It is important to note that the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines is intended for US Federal Agencies and should be viewed in its entirety. Many of the concepts and approaches defined in these guidelines are expected to work with each other and not as standalone parameters. Note: Unless otherwise stated in the requirement, these requirements apply to all accounts on all system components, unless specifically called out in an individual requirement, including but not limited to:  Point-of-sale accounts  Accounts with administrative capabilities  System and application accounts  All accounts used to view or access cardholder data or to access systems with cardholder data. This includes accounts used by employees, contractors, consultants, internal and external vendors, and other third parties (for example, for providing support or maintenance services). Certain requirements are not intended to apply to user accounts on point-of-sale terminals that have access to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction. When items do not apply, they are noted directly within the specific requirement. These requirements do not apply to accounts used by consumers (cardholders).

While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 8, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

formally assigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities may not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed

In turn, this prevents an entity from assigning accountability for, or having effective logging of, an individual’s actions since a given action could have been performed by anyone in the group with knowledge of the user ID and associated authentication factors.The ability to associate individuals to the actions performed with an ID is essential to provide individual accountability and traceability regarding who performed an action, what action was performed, and when that action occurred.Good PracticeIf shared IDs are used for any reason, strong management controls need to be established to maintain individual accountability and traceability.(continued on next page)ExamplesTools and techniques can facilitate both management and security of these types of accounts and confirm individual user identity before access to an account is granted. Entities can consider password vaults or other system- managed controls such as the sudo command.An example of an exceptional circumstance is where all other authentication methods have failed, and a shared ID is needed for emergency use or “break the glass” administrator access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

service provider uses the same authentication factors to access multiple customers, all the service provider’s customers can easily be compromised if an attacker compromises that one factor.Criminals know this and deliberately target service providers looking for a shared authentication factor that gives them remote access to many merchants via that single factor.(continued on next

It is essential to detect and respond when user IDs are created or changed outside the normal change process or without corresponding authorization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

As such, these accounts may be more easily exploited and used to access cardholder data.Good PracticeWhere it may be reasonably anticipated that an account will not be used for an extended period of time, such as an extended leave of absence, the account should be disabled as soon as the leave begins, rather than waiting 90 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This access could result in an unauthorized user in the third party’s environment or a malicious individual using the always-available external entry point into an entity’s network. Where third parties do need access 24/7, it should be documented, justified, monitored, and tied to specific service reasons.(continued on next page)Good PracticeEnabling access only for the time periods needed and disabling it as soon as it is no longer required helps prevent misuse of these connections. Additionally, consider assigning third parties a start and stop date for their access in accordance with their service contract.Monitoring third-party access helps ensure that third parties are accessing only the systems necessary and only during approved time frames.

For example, the screensaver may activate after 15 minutes and log off the user after an hour.However, timeout controls must balance the risk of access and exposure with the impact to the user and purpose of the access.If a user needs to run a program from an unattended computer, the user can log in to the computer to initiate the program, and then “lock” the computer so that no one else can use the user’s login while the computer is unattended.ExamplesOne way to meet this requirement is to configure an automated screensaver to launch whenever the console is idle for 15 minutes and requiring the logged-in user to enter their password to unlock the screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 8.3.1     | Defined Approach Requirements8.3.1 All user access to system components for users and administrators is authenticated via at least one of the following authentication factors:• Something you know, such as a password or passphrase.• Something you have, such as a token device or smart card.• Something you are, such as a biometric element.Customized Approach ObjectiveAn account cannot be accessed except with a combination of user identity and an authentication factor.Applicability NotesThis requirement is not intended to apply to user accounts on point-of-sale terminals that have access to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction.This requirement does not supersede multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements but applies to those in-scope systems not otherwise subject to MFA requirements.A digital certificate is a valid option for “something you have” if it is unique for a particular user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Defined Approach Testing Procedures8.3.1.a Examine documentation describing the authentication factor(s) used to verify that user access to system components is authenticated via at least one authentication factor specified in this requirement.8.3.1.b For each type of authentication factor used with each type of system component, observe an authentication to verify that authentication is functioning consistently with documented authentication factor(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | PurposeWhen used in addition to unique IDs, an authentication factor helps protect user IDs from being compromised, since the attacker needs to have the unique ID and compromise the associated authentication factor(s).Good PracticeA common approach for a malicious individual to compromise a system is to exploit weak or nonexistent authentication factors (for example, passwords/passphrases). Requiring strong authentication factors helps protect against this attack.Further InformationSee fidoalliance.org for more information about using tokens, smart cards, or biometrics as authentication factors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

As a result, a malicious individual can easily intercept this information during transmission using a “sniffer,” or directly access unencrypted authentication factors in files where they are stored, and then use this data to gain unauthorized access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

user—to have an authentication factor changed so they can use a valid user ID.Requiring positive identification of a user reduces the probability of this type of attack succeeding.Good PracticeModifications to authentication factors for which user identity should be verified include but are not limited to performing password resets, provisioning new hardware or software tokens, and generating new keys.ExamplesMethods to verify a user’s identity include a secret question/answer, knowledge-based information, and calling the user back at a known and previously established phone

For example, the administrator or help desk personnel can validate that the actual account owner is requesting reactivation, or there may be password reset self- service mechanisms that the account owner uses to verify their identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

If passwords are short or easily guessable, it is relatively easy for a malicious individual to find these weak accounts and compromise a network under the guise of a valid user ID.Good PracticePassword/passphrase strength is dependent on password/passphrase complexity, length, and randomness. Passwords/passphrases should be sufficiently complex, so they are impractical for an attacker to guess or otherwise discover its value. Entities can consider adding increased complexity by requiring the use of special characters and upper- and lower-case characters, in addition to the minimum standards outlined by this requirement. Additional complexity increases the time required for offline brute force attacks of hashed passwords/passphrases.Another option for increasing the resistance of passwords to guessing attacks is by comparing proposed password/passphrases to a bad password list and having users provide new passwords for any passwords found on the list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Requiring that passwords cannot be reused for a period reduces the likelihood that passwords that have been guessed or brute-forced will be re- used in the future.Passwords or passphrases may have previously been changed due to suspicion of compromise or because the password or passphrase exceeded its effective use period, both of which are reasons why previously used passwords should not be reused.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Instructing users to change passwords if there is a chance the password is no longer secure can prevent malicious users from using a legitimate password to gain unauthorized access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Where passwords/passphrases are employed as the only authentication factor for such access, additional controls are required to protect the integrity of the password/passphrase.Good PracticePasswords/passphrases that are valid for a long time without a change provide malicious individuals with more time to break the password/phrase. Periodically changing passwords offers less time for a malicious individual to crack a password/passphrase and less time to use a compromised password.Using a password/passphrase as the only authentication factor provides a single point of failure if compromised. Therefore, in these implementations, controls are needed to minimize how long malicious activity could occur via a compromised password/passphrase.(continued on next page)Dynamically analyzing an account’s security posture is another option that allows for more rapid detection and response to address potentially compromised credentials. Such analysis takes a number of data points, which may include device integrity, location, access times, and the resources accessed to determine in real time whether an account can be granted access to a requested resource. In this way, access can be denied and accounts blocked if it is suspected that authentication credentials have been compromised.Further InformationFor information about using dynamic analysis to manage user access to resources, see NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Periodically changing passwords offers less time for a malicious individual to crack a password/passphrase and less time to use a compromised password.Dynamically analyzing an account’s security posture is another option that allows for more rapid detection and response to address potentially compromised credentials. Such analysis takes a number of data points which may include device integrity, location, access times, and the resources accessed to determine in real time whether an account can be granted access to a requested resource. In this way, access can be denied and accounts blocked if it is suspected that account credentials have been compromised.Further InformationFor information about using dynamic analysis to manage user access to resources, refer to NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This is especially true in environments where traditionally the single authentication factor employed was something a user knows such as a password or passphrase.Good PracticeImplementing MFA for non-console administrative access to in-scope system components that are not part of the CDE will help prevent unauthorized users from using a single factor to gain access and compromise in-scope system components.DefinitionsUsing one factor twice (for example, using two separate passwords) is not considered multi- factor authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 8.4.2     | Defined Approach Requirements8.4.2 MFA is implemented for all non-console access into the CDE.Customized Approach ObjectiveAccess into the CDE cannot be obtained by the use of a single authentication factor.Applicability NotesThis requirement does not apply to:• Application or system accounts performing automated functions.• User accounts on point-of-sale terminals that have access to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction.• User accounts that are only authenticated with phishing-resistant authentication factors.MFA is required for both types of access specified in Requirements 8.4.2 and 8.4.3. Therefore, applying MFA to one type of access does not replace the need to apply another instance of MFA to the other type of access. If an individual first connects to the entity’s network via remote access, and then later initiates a connection into the CDE from within the network, per this requirement the individual would authenticate using MFA twice, once when connecting via remote access to the entity’s network and once when connecting from the entity’s network into the CDE.(continued on next page)The MFA requirements apply for all types of system components, including cloud, hosted systems, and on-premises applications, network security devices, workstations, servers, and endpoints, and includes access directly to an entity’s networks or systems as well as web-based access to an application or function.MFA for access into the CDE can be implemented at the network or system/application level; it does not have to be applied at both levels. For example, if MFA is used when a user connects to the CDE network, it does not have to be used when the user logs into each system or application within the CDE.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.                                                                                                                                | Defined Approach Testing Procedures8.4.2.a Examine network and/or system configurations to verify MFA is implemented for all non-console access into the CDE.8.4.2.b Observe personnel logging in to the CDE and examine evidence to verify that MFA is required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | PurposeRequiring more than one type of authentication factor reduces the probability that an attacker can gain access to a system by masquerading as a legitimate user, because the attacker would need to compromise multiple authentication factors. This is especially true in environments where traditionally the single authentication factor employed was something a user knows such as a password or passphrase.(continued on next page)DefinitionsUsing one factor twice (for example, using two separate passwords) is not considered multi- factor authentication.Refer to Appendix G for the definition of “phishing resistant authentication.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 8.4.3     | Defined Approach Requirements8.4.3 MFA is implemented for all remote access originating from outside the entity’s network that could access or impact the CDE.Customized Approach ObjectiveRemote access to the entity’s network cannot be obtained by using a single authentication factor.Applicability NotesThe requirement for MFA for remote access originating from outside the entity’s network applies to all user accounts that can access the network remotely, where that remote access leads to or could lead to access into the CDE. This includes all remote access by personnel (users and administrators), and third parties (including, but not limited to, vendors, suppliers, service providers, and customers).If remote access is to a part of the entity’s network that is properly segmented from the CDE, such that remote users cannot access or impact the CDE, MFA for remote access to that part of the network is not required. However, MFA is required for any remote access to networks with access to the CDE and is recommended for all remote access to the entity’s networks.The MFA requirements apply for all types of system components, including cloud, hosted systems, and on-premises applications, network security devices, workstations, servers, and endpoints, and includes access directly to an entity’s networks or systems as well as web-based access to an application or function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Defined Approach Testing Procedures8.4.3.a Examine network and/or system configurations for remote access servers and systems to verify MFA is required in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.8.4.3.b Observe personnel (for example, users and administrators) and third parties connecting remotely to the network and verify that multi-factor authentication is required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | PurposeRequiring more than one type of authentication factor reduces the probability that an attacker can gain access to a system by masquerading as a legitimate user, because the attacker would need to compromise multiple authentication factors. This is especially true in environments where traditionally the single authentication factor employed was something a user knows, such as a password or passphrase.DefinitionsMulti-factor authentication (MFA) requires an individual to present a minimum of two of the three authentication factors specified in Requirement 8.3.1 before access is granted.Using one factor twice (for example, using two separate passwords) is not considered multi- factor authentication.(continued on next page)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 8.5.1     | Defined Approach Requirements8.5.1 MFA systems are implemented as follows:• The MFA system is not susceptible to replay attacks.• MFA systems cannot be bypassed by any users, including administrative users unless specifically documented, and authorized by management on an exception basis, for a limited time period.• At least two different types of authentication factors are used.• Success of all authentication factors is required before access is granted.Customized Approach ObjectiveMFA systems are resistant to attack and strictly control any administrative overrides.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Defined Approach Testing Procedures8.5.1.a Examine vendor system documentation to verify that the MFA system is not susceptible to replay attacks.8.5.1.b Examine system configurations for the MFA implementation to verify it is configured in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.8.5.1.c Interview responsible personnel and observe processes to verify that any requests to bypass MFA are specifically documented and authorized by management on an exception basis, for a limited time period.8.5.1.d Observe personnel logging into system components in the CDE to verify that access is granted only after all authentication factors are successful.8.5.1.e Observe personnel connecting remotely from outside the entity’s network to verify that access is granted only after all authentication factors are successful.                                                                                                                                                                            | PurposePoorly configured MFA systems can be bypassed by attackers. This requirement therefore addresses configuration of MFA system(s) that provide MFA for users accessing system components in the CDE.DefinitionsUsing one type of factor twice (for example, using two separate passwords) is not considered multi- factor authentication.A replay attack is when an attacker intercepts a valid transmission of data and then resends or redirects this communication for malicious purposes. In MFA implementations, replay attacks are typically used to gain unauthorized access by leveraging legitimate credentials.ExamplesExamples of methods to help protect against replay attacks include, but are not limited to:• Unique session identifiers and session keys• Timestamps• Time-based, one-time passwords or passcodes• Anti-replay mechanisms that detect and reject duplicated authentication attempts.(continued on next page)Further InformationFor more information about MFA systems and features, refer to the following:PCI SSC’s Information Supplement: Multi-Factor AuthenticationPCI SSC’s Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on this topic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 8.6.3     | Defined Approach Requirements8.6.3 Passwords/passphrases for any application and system accounts are protected against misuse as follows:• Passwords/passphrases are changed periodically (at the frequency defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1) and upon suspicion or confirmation of compromise.• Passwords/passphrases are constructed with sufficient complexity appropriate for how frequently the entity changes the passwords/passphrases.Customized Approach ObjectivePasswords/passphrases used by application and system accounts cannot be used indefinitely and are structured to resist brute-force and guessing attacks.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.8.6.3 (continued)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Defined Approach Testing Procedures8.6.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verify that procedures are defined to protect passwords/passphrases for application or system accounts against misuse in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.8.6.3.b Examine the entity’s targeted risk analysis for the change frequency and complexity for passwords/passphrases for application and system accounts to verify the risk analysis was performed in accordance with all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1 and addresses:• The frequency defined for periodic changes to application and system passwords/passphrases.• The complexity defined for passwords/passphrases and appropriateness of the complexity relative to the frequency of changes.8.6.3.c Interview responsible personnel and examine system configuration settings to verify that passwords/passphrases for any application and system accounts are protected against misuse in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement. | PurposeSystems and application accounts pose more inherent security risk than user accounts because they often run in an elevated security context, with access to systems that may not be typically granted to user accounts, such as programmatic access to databases, etc. As a result, special consideration must be made to protect passwords/passphrases used for application and system accounts.Good PracticeEntities should consider the following risk factors when determining how to protect application and system passwords/passphrases against misuse:• How securely the passwords/passphrases are stored (for example, whether they are stored in a password vault).• Staff turnover.• The number of people with access to the authentication factor.• Whether the account can be used for interactive login.• Whether the security posture of accounts is dynamically analyzed, and real-time access to resources is automatically determined accordingly (see Requirement 8.3.9).All these elements affect the level of risk for application and system accounts and might impact the security of systems accessed by the system and application accounts.(continued on next page)Entities should correlate their selected change frequency for application and system passwords/passwords with their selected complexity for those passwords/passphrases – i.e., the complexity should be more rigorous when passwords/passphrases are changed infrequently and can be less rigorous when changed more frequently. For example, a longer change frequency is more justifiable when passwords/passphrases complexity is set to 36 alphanumeric characters with upper- and lower- case letters, numbers, and special characters.Best practices are to consider password changes at least once a year, a password/passphrase length of at least 15 characters, and complexity for the passwords/passphrase of alphanumeric characters, with upper- and lower-case letters, and special characters.Further InformationFor information about variability and equivalency of password strength for passwords/passphrases of different formats, see the industry standards (for example, the current version of NIST SP 800- 63 Digital Identity Guidelines).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

There are three different areas mentioned in Requirement 9: 1. Requirements that specifically refer to sensitive areas are intended to apply to those areas only. Each entity should identify the sensitive areas in its environments to ensure the appropriate physical controls are implemented. 2. Requirements that specifically refer to the cardholder data environment (CDE) are intended to apply to the entire CDE, including any sensitive areas residing within the CDE. 3. Requirements that specifically refer to the facility are referencing the types of controls that may be managed more broadly at the physical boundary of a business premise (such as a building) within which CDEs and sensitive areas reside. These controls often exist outside a CDE or sensitive area, for example a guard desk that identifies, badges, and logs visitors. The term “facility” is used to recognize that these controls may exist at different places within a facility, for instance, at building entry or at an internal entrance to a data center or office space. Refer to Appendix G for definitions of “media,” “personnel,” “sensitive areas,” “visitors,” and other PCI DSS terms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 9, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.Policies and procedures, including updates, are actively communicated to all affected personnel, and are supported by operating procedures describing how to perform activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

formally assigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities, and critical activities may not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.A method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix).

Therefore, the purpose of this requirement is that physical access to the CDE is controlled via physical security controls such as badge readers or other mechanisms such as lock and key.Good PracticeWhichever mechanism meets this requirement, it must be sufficient for the organization to verify that only authorized personnel are granted access.ExamplesFacility entry controls include physical security controls at each computer room, data center, and other physical areas with systems in the CDE. It can also include badge readers or other devices that manage physical access controls, such as lock and key with a current list of all individuals holding the keys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

To protect these controls from tampering, video cameras could be positioned so they are out of reach and/or be monitored to detect tampering. Similarly, physical access control mechanisms could be monitored or have physical protections installed to prevent them from being damaged or disabled by malicious individuals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

In addition, it is important to limit access to the actual badging system and badging materials to prevent unauthorized personnel from making their own badges and/or setting up their own access rules.Good PracticeIt is important to visually identify the personnel that are physically present, and whether the individual is a visitor or an employee.DefinitionsRefer to Appendix G for the definition of “personnel.”ExamplesOne way to identify personnel is to assign them badges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

It will assist in identifying historical physical access to a building or room and potential access to cardholder data.Good PracticeWhen logging the date and time of visit, including both in and out times is considered a best practice, since it provides helpful tracking information and provides assurance that a visitor has left at the end of the day. It is also good to verify that a visitor’s ID (driver’s license, etc.) matches the name they put on the visitor log.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

and its location would be unknown, leading to lost or stolen media.

| 9.4.6     | Defined Approach Requirements9.4.6 Hard-copy materials with cardholder data are destroyed when no longer needed for business or legal reasons, as follows:• Materials are cross-cut shredded, incinerated, or pulped so that cardholder data cannot be reconstructed.• Materials are stored in secure storage containers prior to destruction.Customized Approach ObjectiveCardholder data cannot be recovered from media that has been destroyed or which is pending destruction.Applicability NotesThese requirements for media destruction when that media is no longer needed for business or legal reasons are separate and distinct from PCI DSS Requirement 3.2.1, which is for securely deleting cardholder data when no longer needed per the entity’s cardholder data retention policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Defined Approach Testing Procedures9.4.6.a Examine the media destruction policy to verify that procedures are defined to destroy hard- copy media with cardholder data when no longer needed for business or legal reasons in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.9.4.6.b Observe processes and interview personnel to verify that hard-copy materials are cross-cut shredded, incinerated, or pulped such that cardholder data cannot be reconstructed.9.4.6.c Observe storage containers used for materials that contain information to be destroyed to verify that the containers are secure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | PurposeIf steps are not taken to destroy information contained on hard-copy media before disposal, malicious individuals may retrieve information from the disposed media, leading to a data compromise. For example, malicious individuals may use a technique known as “dumpster diving,” where they search through trashcans and recycle bins looking for hard-copy materials with information they can use to launch an attack.Securing storage containers used for materials that are going to be destroyed prevents sensitive information from being captured while the materials are being collected.Good PracticeConsider “to-be-shredded” containers with a lock that prevents access to its contents or that physically prevent access to the inside of the container.Further InformationSee NIST Special Publication 800-88, Revision 1: Guidelines for Media Sanitization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

For example, malicious individuals may use a technique known as “dumpster diving,” where they search through trashcans and recycle bins looking for information they can use to launch an attack.Good PracticeThe deletion function in most operating systems allows deleted data to be recovered, so instead, a dedicated secure deletion function or application should be used to make data unrecoverable.ExamplesMethods for securely destroying electronic media include secure wiping in accordance with industry-accepted standards for secure deletion, degaussing, or physical destruction (such as grinding or shredding hard disks).Further InformationSee NIST Special Publication 800-88, Revision 1: Guidelines for Media Sanitization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Criminals will try to steal devices so they can learn how to break into them, and they often try to replace legitimate devices with fraudulent devices that send them payment card data every time a card is entered.They will also try to add “skimming” components to the outside of devices, which are designed to capture payment card data before it enters the device—for example, by attaching an additional card reader on top of the legitimate card reader so that the payment card data is captured twice: once by the criminal’s component and then by the device’s legitimate component. In this way, transactions may still be completed without interruption while the criminal is “skimming” the payment card data during the process.(continued on next page)Good PracticeEntities may consider implementing protection from tampering and unauthorized substitution for:• Components used only for manual PAN key entry.• Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices (for example, smartphones or tablets), which are mobile merchant-owned devices designed for mass-market distribution.Further InformationAdditional best practices on skimming prevention are available on the PCI SSC website.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

For instance, photographs of devices known to be secure can be used to compare a device’s current appearance with its original appearance to see whether it has changed. Another option may be to use a secure marker pen, such as a UV light marker, to mark device surfaces and device openings so any tampering or replacement will be apparent. Criminals will often replace the outer casing of a device to hide their tampering, and these methods may help to detect such activities. Device vendors may also provide security guidance and “how to” guides to help determine whether the device has been subject to tampering.Signs that a device might have been tampered with or substituted include:• Unexpected attachments or cables plugged into the device.• Missing or changed security labels.• Broken or differently colored casing.• Changes to the serial number or other external markings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

For example, devices left in public areas without supervision by the organization’s personnel might have more frequent inspections than devices kept in secure areas or supervised when accessible to the public. In addition, many POI vendors include guidance in their user documentation about how often POI devices should be checked, and for what – entities should consult their vendors’ documentation and incorporate those recommendations into their periodic inspections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Many criminals will try to fool personnel by dressing for the part (for example, carrying toolboxes and dressed in work apparel), and could also be knowledgeable about locations of devices, so personnel should be trained to always follow procedures.Another trick that criminals use is to send a “new” POI device with instructions for swapping it with a legitimate device and “returning” the legitimate device. The criminals may even provide return postage to their specified address. Therefore, personnel should always verify with their manager or supplier that the device is legitimate and came from a trusted source before installing it or using it for business.(continued on next page)ExamplesSuspicious behavior that personnel should be aware of includes attempts by unknown persons to unplug or open devices.Ensuring personnel are aware of mechanisms for reporting suspicious behavior and who to report such behavior to—for example, a manager or security officer—will help reduce the likelihood and potential impact of a device being tampered with or substituted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The presence of logs on all system components and in the cardholder data environment (CDE) allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis when something does go wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is difficult, if not impossible, without system activity logs. This requirement applies to user activities, including those by employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors, and other third parties (for example, those providing support or maintenance services). These requirements do not apply to user activity of consumers (cardholders).

While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 10, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

formally assigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities may not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed

Audit logs send alerts the system administrator, provides data to other monitoring mechanisms, such as intrusion-detection systems (IDS) and security information and event monitoring systems (SIEM) tools, and provide a history trail for post-incident investigation.Logging and analyzing security-relevant events enable an organization to identify and trace potentially malicious activities.Good PracticeWhen an entity considers which information to record in their logs, it is important to remember that information stored in audit logs is sensitive and should be protected per requirements in this standard. Care should be taken to only store essential information in the audit logs to minimize risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This access includes audit log files on the originating systems as well as anywhere else they are stored.Good PracticeAdequate protection of the audit logs includes strong access control that limits access to logs based on “need to know” only and the use of physical or network segregation to make the logs harder to find and modify.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Without adequate protection of audit logs, their completeness, accuracy, and integrity cannot be guaranteed, and the audit logs can be rendered useless as an investigation tool after a compromise. Therefore, audit logs should be protected on the originating systems as well as anywhere else they are stored.Good PracticeEntities should attempt to prevent logs from being exposed in public-accessible locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

For file integrity monitoring purposes, an entity usually monitors files that do not regularly change, but when changed, indicate a possible compromise.Good PracticeSoftware used to monitor changes to audit logs should be configured to provide alerts when existing log data or files are changed or deleted. However, new log data being added to an audit log should not generate an alert.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Regular log reviews mean incidents can be quickly identified and proactively addressed.Good PracticeChecking logs daily (7 days a week, 365 days a year, including holidays) minimizes the amount of time and exposure of a potential breach. Log harvesting, parsing, and alerting tools, centralized log management systems, event log analyzers, and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions are examples of automated tools that can be used to meet this requirement.Daily review of security events—for example, notifications or alerts that identify suspicious or anomalous activities—as well as logs from critical system components, and logs from systems that perform security functions, such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, file integrity monitoring (FIM) systems, etc., is necessary to identify potential issues.The determination of “security event” will vary for each organization and may include consideration for the type of technology, location, and function of the device. Organizations may also wish to maintain a baseline of “normal” traffic to help identify anomalous behavior.An entity that uses third-party service providers to perform log review services is responsible to provide context about the entity’s environment to the service providers, so it understands the entity’s environment, has a baseline of “normal” traffic for the entity, and can detect potential security issues and provide accurate exceptions and anomaly notifications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The analysis of new audit activity against the established baseline can significantly improve the identification of suspicious or anomalous activities.The entity should keep logging tools aligned with any changes in their environment by periodically reviewing tool settings and updating settings to reflect any changes.Further InformationRefer to the Information Supplement: Effective Daily Log Monitoring for additional guidance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

malicious activities occurring within their network.Good PracticeEntities should consider how to address the following when developing their processes for defining and managing exceptions and anomalies:• How log review activities are recorded,• How to rank and prioritize exceptions and anomalies,• What procedures should be in place to report and escalate exceptions and anomalies, and• Who

Having centrally stored log history allows investigators to better determine the length of time a potential breach was occurring, and the possible system(s) impacted. By having three months of logs immediately available, an entity can quickly identify and minimize impact of a data breach.ExamplesMethods that allow logs to be immediately available include storing logs online, archiving logs, or restoring logs quickly from backups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

In addition, personnel should be aware of their responsibilities in the event of a failure.

While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 11, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.Good PracticeIt is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.DefinitionsSecurity policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

formally assigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities may not occur.Good PracticeRoles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.ExamplesA method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix).

| 11.2.1    | Defined Approach Requirements11.2.1 Authorized and unauthorized wireless access points are managed as follows:• The presence of wireless (Wi-Fi) access points is tested for,• All authorized and unauthorized wireless access points are detected and identified,• Testing, detection, and identification occurs at least once every three months.• If automated monitoring is used, personnel are notified via generated alerts.Customized Approach ObjectiveUnauthorized wireless access points are identified and addressed periodically.Applicability NotesThe requirement applies even when a policy exists that prohibits the use of wireless technology.Methods used to meet this requirement must be sufficient to detect and identify both authorized and unauthorized devices, including unauthorized devices attached to devices that themselves are authorized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Defined Approach Testing Procedures11.2.1.a Examine policies and procedures to verify processes are defined for managing both authorized and unauthorized wireless access points with all elements specified in this requirement.11.2.1.b Examine the methodology(ies) in use and the resulting documentation, and interview personnel to verify processes are defined to detect and identify both authorized and unauthorized wireless access points in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.11.2.1.c Examine wireless assessment results and interview personnel to verify that wireless assessments were conducted in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.11.2.1.d If automated monitoring is used, examine configuration settings to verify the configuration will generate alerts to notify personnel.                                                                                                                                                                                  | PurposeImplementation and/or exploitation of wireless technology within a network are common paths for malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the network and cardholder data. Unauthorized wireless devices could be hidden within or attached to a computer or other system component. These devices could also be attached directly to a network port, to a network device such as a switch or router, or inserted as a wireless interface card inside a system component.Even if a company has a policy prohibiting the use of wireless technologies, an unauthorized wireless device or network could be installed without the company’s knowledge, allowing an attacker to enter the network easily and “invisibly.” Detecting and removing such unauthorized access points reduces the duration and likelihood of such devices being leveraged for an attack.(continued on next page)Good PracticeThe size and complexity of an environment will dictate the appropriate tools and processes to be used to provide sufficient assurance that a rogue wireless access point has not been installed in the environment.For example, performing a detailed physical inspection of a single stand-alone retail kiosk in a shopping mall, where all communication components are contained within tamper-resistant and tamper-evident casings, may be sufficient to provide assurance that a rogue wireless access point has not been attached or installed. However, in an environment with multiple nodes (such as in a large retail store, call center, server room or data center), detailed physical inspection can be difficult. In this case, multiple methods may be combined, such as performing physical system inspections in conjunction with the results of a wireless analyzer.DefinitionsThis is also referred to as rogue access point detection.ExamplesMethods that may be used include but are not limited to wireless network scans, physical/logical inspections of system components and infrastructure, network access control (NAC), or wireless IDS/IPS. NAC and wireless IDS/IPS are examples of automated monitoring tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This helps to proactively minimize the exposure of CDE to malicious individuals.Good PracticeIf using a wireless scanner, it is equally important to have a defined list of known access points which, while not attached to the company’s network, will usually be detected during a scan. These non-company devices are often found in multi-tenant buildings or businesses located near one another. However, it is important to verify that these devices are not connected to the entity’s network port or through another network- connected device and given an SSID resembling a nearby business. Scan results should note such devices and how it was determined that these devices could be “ignored.” In addition, detection of any unauthorized wireless access points that are determined to be a threat to the CDE should be managed following the entity’s incident response plan per Requirement 12.10.1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 11.3.1    | Defined Approach Requirements11.3.1 Internal vulnerability scans are performed as follows:• At least once every three months.• Vulnerabilities that are either high-risk or critical (according to the entity’s vulnerability risk rankings defined at Requirement 6.3.1) are resolved.• Rescans are performed that confirm all high-risk and all critical vulnerabilities (as noted above) have been resolved.• Scan tool is kept up to date with latest vulnerability information.• Scans are performed by qualified personnel and organizational independence of the tester exists.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe security posture of all system components is verified periodically using automated tools designed to detect vulnerabilities operating inside the network. Detected vulnerabilities are assessed and rectified based on a formal risk assessment framework.(continued on next page)Applicability NotesIt is not required to use a QSA or ASV to conduct internal vulnerability scans.Internal vulnerability scans can be performed by qualified, internal staff that are reasonably independent of the system component(s) being scanned (for example, a network administrator should not be responsible for scanning the network), or an entity may choose to have internal vulnerability scans performed by a firm specializing in vulnerability scanning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Defined Approach Testing Procedures11.3.1.a Examine internal scan report results from the last 12 months to verify that internal scans occurred at least once every three months in the most recent 12-month period.11.3.1.b Examine internal scan report results from each scan and rescan run in the last 12 months to verify that all high-risk vulnerabilities and all critical vulnerabilities (defined in PCI DSS Requirement 6.3.1) are resolved.11.3.1.c Examine scan tool configurations and interview personnel to verify that the scan tool is kept up to date with the latest vulnerability information.11.3.1.d Interview responsible personnel to verify that the scan was performed by a qualified internal resource(s) or qualified external third party and that organizational independence of the tester exists.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | PurposeIdentifying and addressing vulnerabilities promptly reduces the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the potential compromise of a system component or cardholder data. Vulnerability scans conducted at least every three months provide this detection and identification.Good PracticeVulnerabilities posing the greatest risk to the environment (for example, ranked high or critical per Requirement 6.3.1) should be resolved with the highest priority. Vulnerabilities identified during internal vulnerability scans should be part of a vulnerability management process that includes multiple vulnerability sources, as specified in Requirement 6.3.1.Multiple scan reports can be combined for the quarterly scan process to show that all systems were scanned and all applicable vulnerabilities were resolved as part of the three-month vulnerability scan cycle. However, additional documentation may be required to verify non- remediated vulnerabilities are in the process of being resolved.While scans are required at least once every three months, more frequent scans are recommended depending on the network complexity, frequency of change, and types of devices, software, and operating systems used.(continued on next page)DefinitionsA vulnerability scan is a combination of automated tools, techniques, and/or methods run against external and internal devices and servers, designed to expose potential vulnerabilities in applications, operating systems, and network devices that could be found and exploited by malicious individuals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 11.3.1.1  | Defined Approach Requirements11.3.1.1 All other applicable vulnerabilities (those not ranked as high-risk vulnerabilities or critical vulnerabilities according to the entity’s vulnerability risk rankings defined at Requirement 6.3.1) are managed as follows:• Addressed based on the risk defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1.• Rescans are conducted as needed.Customized Approach ObjectiveLower ranked vulnerabilities (lower than high-risk or critical) are addressed at a frequency in accordance with the entity’s risk.Applicability NotesThe timeframe for addressing lower-risk vulnerabilities is subject to the results of a risk analysis per Requirement 12.3.1 that includes (minimally) identification of assets being protected, threats, and likelihood and/or impact of a threat being realized.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be

| 11.3.1.2  | Defined Approach Requirements11.3.1.2 Internal vulnerability scans are performed via authenticated scanning as follows:• Systems that are unable to accept credentials for authenticated scanning are documented.• Sufficient privileges are used for those systems that accept credentials for scanning.• If accounts used for authenticated scanning can be used for interactive login, they are managed in accordance with Requirement 8.2.2.Customized Approach ObjectiveAutomated tools used to detect vulnerabilities can detect vulnerabilities local to each system, which are not visible remotely.Applicability NotesThe authenticated scanning tools can be either host-based or network-based.“Sufficient” privileges are those needed to access system resources such that a thorough scan can be conducted that detects known vulnerabilities.This requirement does not apply to system components that cannot accept credentials for scanning. Examples of systems that may not accept credentials for scanning include some network and security appliances, mainframes, and containers.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Defined Approach Testing Procedures11.3.1.2.a Examine scan tool configurations to verify that authenticated scanning is used for internal scans, with sufficient privileges, for those systems that accept credentials for scanning.11.3.1.2.b Examine scan report results and interview personnel to verify that authenticated scans are performed.11.3.1.2.c If accounts used for authenticated scanning can be used for interactive login, examine the accounts and interview personnel to verify the accounts are managed following all elements specified in Requirement 8.2.2.11.3.1.2.d Examine documentation to verify that systems that are unable to accept credentials for authenticated scanning are defined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | PurposeAuthenticated scanning provides greater insight into an entity’s vulnerability landscape since it can detect vulnerabilities that unauthenticated scans cannot detect. Attackers may leverage vulnerabilities that an entity is unaware of because certain vulnerabilities will only be detected with authenticated scanning.Authenticated scanning can yield significant additional information about an organization’s vulnerabilities.Good PracticeThe credentials used for these scans should be considered highly privileged. They should be protected and controlled as such, following PCI DSS Requirements 7 and 8 (except for those requirements for multi-factor authentication and application and system accounts).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 11.3.1.3  | Defined Approach Requirements11.3.1.3 Internal vulnerability scans are performed after any significant change as follows:• Vulnerabilities that are either high-risk or critical (according to the entity’s vulnerability risk rankings defined at Requirement 6.3.1) are resolved.• Rescans are conducted as needed.• Scans are performed by qualified personnel and organizational independence of the tester exists (not required to be a QSA or ASV).Customized Approach ObjectiveThe security posture of all system components is verified following significant changes to the network or systems, by using automated tools designed to detect vulnerabilities operating inside the network. Detected vulnerabilities are assessed and rectified based on a formal risk assessment framework.Applicability NotesAuthenticated internal vulnerability scanning per Requirement 11.3.1.2 is not required for scans performed after significant changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Defined Approach Testing Procedures11.3.1.3.a Examine change control documentation and internal scan reports to verify that system components were scanned after any significant changes.11.3.1.3.b Interview personnel and examine internal scan and rescan reports to verify that internal scans were performed after significant changes and that all high-risk vulnerabilities and all critical vulnerabilities (defined in PCI DSS Requirement 6.3.1) were resolved.11.3.1.3.c Interview personnel to verify that internal scans are performed by a qualified internal resource(s) or qualified external third party and that organizational independence of the tester exists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | PurposeScanning an environment after any significant changes ensures that changes were completed appropriately such that the security of the environment was not compromised because of the change.Good PracticeEntities should perform scans after significant changes as part of the change process per Requirement 6.5.2 and before considering the change complete.

| 11.3.2    | Defined Approach Requirements11.3.2 External vulnerability scans are performed as follows:• At least once every three months.• By a PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV).• Vulnerabilities are resolved and ASV Program Guide requirements for a passing scan are met.• Rescans are performed as needed to confirm that vulnerabilities are resolved per the ASV Program Guide requirements for a passing scan.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Applicability NotesFor the initial PCI DSS assessment against this requirement, it is not required that four passing scans be completed within 12 months if the assessor verifies: 1) the most recent scan result was a passing scan, 2) the entity has documented policies and procedures requiring scanning at least once every three months, and 3) vulnerabilities noted in the scan results have been corrected as shown in a re-scan(s).(continued on next page)However, for subsequent years after the initial PCI DSS assessment, passing scans at least every three months must have occurred.ASV scanning tools can scan a vast array of network types and topologies. Any specifics about the target environment (for example, load balancers, third-party providers, ISPs, specific configurations, protocols in use, scan interference) should be worked out between the ASV and scan customer.Refer to the ASV Program Guide published on the PCI SSC website for scan customer responsibilities, scan preparation, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Defined Approach Testing Procedures11.3.2.a Examine ASV scan reports from the last 12 months to verify that external vulnerability scans occurred at least once every three months in the most recent 12-month period.11.3.2.b Examine the ASV scan report from each scan and rescan run in the last 12 months to verify that vulnerabilities are resolved and the ASV Program Guide requirements for a passing scan are met.11.3.2.c Examine the ASV scan reports to verify that the scans were completed by a PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | PurposeAttackers routinely look for unpatched or vulnerable externally facing servers, which can be leveraged to launch a directed attack. Organizations must ensure these externally facing devices are regularly scanned for weaknesses and that vulnerabilities are patched or remediated to protect the entity.Because external networks are at greater risk of compromise, external vulnerability scanning must be performed at least once every three months by a PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV).Good PracticeWhile scans are required at least once every three months, more frequent scans are recommended depending on the network complexity, frequency of change, and types of devices, software, and operating systems used.Vulnerabilities identified during external vulnerability scans should be part of a vulnerability management process that includes multiple vulnerability sources, as specified in Requirement 6.3.1.Multiple scan reports can be combined to show that all systems were scanned and that all applicable vulnerabilities were resolved as part of the three-month vulnerability scan cycle. However, additional documentation may be required to verify non-remediated vulnerabilities are in the process of being resolved.Further InformationSee the ASV Program Guide on the PCI SSC website.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 11.3.2.1  | Defined Approach Requirements11.3.2.1 External vulnerability scans are performed after any significant change as follows:• Vulnerabilities that are scored 4.0 or higher by the CVSS are resolved.• Rescans are conducted as needed.• Scans are performed by qualified personnel and organizational independence of the tester exists (not required to be a QSA or ASV).Customized Approach ObjectiveThe security posture of all system components is verified following significant changes to the network or systems, by using tools designed to detect vulnerabilities operating from outside the network. Detected vulnerabilities are assessed and rectified based on a formal risk assessment framework.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Defined Approach Testing Procedures11.3.2.1.a Examine change control documentation and external scan reports to verify that system components were scanned after any significant changes.11.3.2.1.b Interview personnel and examine external scan and rescan reports to verify that external scans were performed after significant changes and that vulnerabilities scored 4.0 or higher by the CVSS were resolved.11.3.2.1.c Interview personnel to verify that external scans are performed by a qualified internal resource(s) or qualified external third party and that organizational independence of the tester exists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | PurposeScanning an environment after any significant changes ensures that changes were completed appropriately such that the security of the environment was not compromised because of the change.Good PracticeEntities should include the need to perform scans after significant changes as part of the change process and before the change is considered complete.

As such, entities need to test their networks thoroughly, just as an attacker would do. This testing allows the entity to identify and remediate weakness that might be leveraged to compromise the entity’s network and data, and then to take appropriate actions to protect the network and system components from such attacks.Good PracticePenetration testing techniques will differ based on an organization’s needs and structure and should be suitable for the tested environment—for example, fuzzing, injection, and forgery tests might be appropriate. The type, depth, and complexity of the testing will depend on the specific environment and the needs of the organization.DefinitionsPenetration tests simulate a real-world attack situation intending to identify how far an attacker could penetrate an environment, given differing amounts of information provided to the tester. This allows an entity to better understand its potential exposure and develop a strategy to defend against attacks. A penetration test differs from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is an active process that usually includes exploiting identified vulnerabilities.(continued on next page)Scanning for vulnerabilities alone is not a penetration test, nor is a penetration test adequate if the focus is solely on trying to exploit vulnerabilities found in a vulnerability scan. Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the first steps, but it is not the only step a penetration tester will perform to plan the testing strategy. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps.Penetration testing is a highly manual process. While some automated tools may be used, the tester uses their knowledge of systems to gain access into an environment. Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with the goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For example, if the tester finds a way to gain access to an application server, the tester will then use the compromised server as a point to stage a new attack based on the resources to which the server has access. In this way, a tester can simulate the techniques used by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the environment. The testing of security monitoring and detection methods—for example, to confirm the effectiveness of logging and file integrity monitoring mechanisms, should also be considered.(continued on next page)Further InformationRefer to the Information Supplement: Penetration Testing Guidance for additional guidance.Industry-accepted penetration testing approaches include:The Open Source Security Testing Methodology and Manual (OSSTMM)Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) penetration testing programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Firstly, just like an external penetration test, it discovers vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could be used by an attacker that had managed to get some degree of access to the internal network, whether that is because the attacker is an authorized user conducting unauthorized activities, or an external attacker that had managed to penetrate the entity’s perimeter.Secondly, internal penetration testing also helps entities to discover where their change control process failed by detecting previously unknown systems. Additionally, it verifies the status of many of the controls operating within the CDE.A penetration test is not truly a “test” because the outcome of a penetration test is not something that can be classified as a “pass” or a “fail.” The best outcome of a test is a catalog of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that an entitydid not know about, and the penetration tester                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

A penetration test that found nothing is typically indicative of shortcomings of the penetration tester, rather than being a positive reflection of the security posture of the entity.Good PracticeSome considerations when choosing a qualified resource to perform penetration testing include:• Specific penetration testing certifications, which may be an indication of the tester’s skill level and competence.• Prior experience conducting penetration testing—for example, the number of years of experience, and the type and scope of prior engagements can help confirm whether the tester’s experience is appropriate for the needs of the engagement.Further InformationRefer to the Information Supplement: Penetration Testing Guidance on the PCI SSC website for additional guidance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Remediating the vulnerabilities found by a penetration test significantly reduces the probability that the same vulnerabilities will be exploited by a malicious attacker.Using the entity’s own vulnerability risk assessment process (see requirement 6.3.1) ensures that the vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk to the entity will be remediated more quickly.Good PracticeAs part of the entity’s assessment of risk, entities should consider how likely the vulnerability is to be exploited and whether there are other controls present in the environment to reduce the risk.Any weaknesses that point to PCI DSS requirements not being met should be addressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Using penetration testing tools and techniques to validate that an untrusted network is indeed isolated from the CDE can alert the entity to a failure or misconfiguration of the segmentation controls, which can then be rectified.Good PracticeTechniques such as host discovery and port scanning can be used to verify out-of-scope segments have no access to the CDE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The probability of segmentation controls failing in complex and dynamic networks is greater in service-provider environments.Validating segmentation controls more frequently is likely to discover such failings before they can be exploited by an attacker attempting to pivot laterally from an out-of-scope untrusted network to the CDE.Good PracticeAlthough the requirement specifies that this scope validation is carried out at least once every six months and after significant change, this exercise should be performed as frequently as possible to ensure it remains effective at isolating the CDE from other networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

In shared and cloud environments, the multi-tenant service provider may be concerned about the activities of a penetration tester affecting other customers’ systems.Multi-tenant service providers cannot forbid penetration testing because this would leave their customers’ systems open to exploitation. Therefore, multi-tenant service providers must support customer requests to conduct penetration testing or for penetration testing results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 11.5.1    | Defined Approach Requirements11.5.1 Intrusion-detection and/or intrusion- prevention techniques are used to detect and/or prevent intrusions into the network as follows:• All traffic is monitored at the perimeter of the CDE.• All traffic is monitored at critical points in the CDE.• Personnel are alerted to suspected compromises.• All intrusion-detection and prevention engines, baselines, and signatures are kept up to date.Customized Approach ObjectiveMechanisms to detect real-time suspicious or anomalous network traffic that may be indicative of threat actor activity are implemented. Alerts generated by these mechanisms are responded to by personnel, or by automated means that ensure that system components cannot be compromised as a result of the detected activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Defined Approach Testing Procedures11.5.1.a Examine system configurations and network diagrams to verify that intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques are in place to monitor all traffic:• At the perimeter of the CDE.• At critical points in the CDE.11.5.1.b Examine system configurations and interview responsible personnel to verify intrusion- detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques alert personnel of suspected compromises.11.5.1.c Examine system configurations and vendor documentation to verify intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques are configured to keep all engines, baselines, and signatures up to date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | PurposeIntrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques (such as IDS/IPS) compare the traffic coming into the network with known “signatures” and/or behaviors of thousands of compromise types (hacker tools, Trojans, and other malware), and then send alerts and/or stop the attempt as it happens. Without a proactive approach to detect unauthorized activity, attacks on (or misuse of) computer resources could go unnoticed for long periods of time. The impact of an intrusion into the CDE is, in many ways, a factor of the time that an attacker has in the environment before being detected.Good PracticeSecurity alerts generated by these techniques should be continually monitored, so that the attempted or actual intrusions can be stopped, and potential damage limited.DefinitionsCritical locations could include, but are not limited to, network security controls between network segments (for example, between a DMZ and an internal network or between an in-scope and out- of-scope network) and points protecting connections between a less trusted and a more trusted system component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

When deciding where to place this control, entities should consider critical locations in the network, and likely routes for covert channels.When malware establishes a foothold in an infected environment, it often tries to establish a communication channel to a command-and- control (C&amp;C) server. Through the C&amp;C server, the attacker communicates with and controls malware on compromised systems to deliver malicious payloads or instructions, or to initiate data exfiltration. In many cases, the malware will communicate with the C&amp;C server indirectly via botnets, bypassing monitoring, blocking controls, and rendering these methods ineffective to detect the covert channels.(continued on next page)Good PracticeMethods that can help detect and address malware communications channels include real- time endpoint scanning, egress traffic filtering, an ”allow” listing, data loss prevention tools, and network security monitoring tools such as IDS/IPS. Additionally, DNS queries and responses are a key data source used by network defenders in support of incident response as well as intrusion discovery. When these transactions are collected for processing and analytics, they can enable a number of valuable security analytic scenarios.It is important that organizations maintain up-to- date knowledge of malware modes of operation, as mitigating these can help detect and limit the impact of malware in the environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11.5.2    | Defined Approach Requirements11.5.2 A change-detection mechanism (for example, file integrity monitoring tools) is deployed as follows:• To alert personnel to unauthorized modification (including changes, additions, and deletions) of critical files.• To perform critical file comparisons at least once weekly.Customized Approach ObjectiveCritical files cannot be modified by unauthorized personnel without an alert being generated.(continued on next page)Applicability NotesFor change-detection purposes, critical files are usually those that do not regularly change, but the modification of which could indicate a system compromise or risk of compromise. Change- detection mechanisms such as file integrity monitoring products usually come pre-configured with critical files for the related operating system. Other critical files, such as those for custom applications, must be evaluated and defined by the entity (that is, the merchant or service provider).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Defined Approach Testing Procedures11.5.2.a Examine system settings, monitored files, and results from monitoring activities to verify the use of a change-detection mechanism.11.5.2.b Examine settings for the change-detection mechanism to verify it is configured in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | PurposeChanges to critical system, configuration, or content files can be an indicator an attacker has accessed an organization’s system. Such changes can allow an attacker to take additional malicious actions, access cardholder data, and/or conduct activities without detection or record.A change detection mechanism will detect and evaluate such changes to critical files and generate alerts that can be responded to following defined processes so that personnel can take appropriate actions.(continued on next page)If not implemented properly and the output of the change-detection solution monitored, a malicious individual could add, remove, or alter configuration file contents, operating system programs, or application executables. Unauthorized changes, if undetected, could render existing security controls ineffective and/or result in cardholder data being stolen with no perceptible impact to normal processing.Good PracticeExamples of the types of files that should be monitored include, but are not limited to:• System executables.• Application executables.• Configuration and parameter files.• Centrally stored, historical, or archived audit logs.• Additional critical files determined by entity (for example, through risk assessment or other means).ExamplesChange-detection solutions such as file integrity monitoring (FIM) tools check for changes, additions, and deletions to critical files, and notify when such changes are detected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 11.6.1    | Defined Approach Requirements11.6.1 A change- and tamper-detection mechanism is deployed as follows:• To alert personnel to unauthorized modification (including indicators of compromise, changes, additions, and deletions) to the security- impacting HTTP headers and the script contents of payment pages as received by the consumer browser.• The mechanism is configured to evaluate the received HTTP headers and payment pages.• The mechanism functions are performed as follows:– At least weeklyOR– Periodically (at the frequency defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1).Customized Approach ObjectiveE-commerce skimming code or techniques cannot be added to payment pages as received by the consumer browser without a timely alert being generated. Anti-skimming measures cannot be removed from payment pages without a prompt alert being generated.(continued on next page)Applicability NotesThis requirement also applies to entities with a webpage(s) that includes a TPSP’s/payment processor’s embedded payment page/form (for example, one or more inline frames or iframes.)This requirement does not apply to an entity for scripts in a TPSP’s/payment processor’s embedded payment page/form (for example, one or more iframes), where the entity includes a TPSP’s/payment processor’s payment page/form on its webpage.Scripts in the TPSP’s/payment processor’s embedded payment page/form are the responsibility of the TPSP/payment processor to manage in accordance with this requirement.The intention of this requirement is not that an entity installs software in the systems or browsers of its consumers, but rather that the entity uses techniques such as those described under Examples in the Guidance column to prevent and detect unexpected script activities.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Maintain an Information Security Policy | Defined Approach Testing Procedures11.6.1.a Examine system settings, monitored payment pages, and results from monitoring activities to verify the use of a change- and tamper- detection mechanism.11.6.1.b Examine configuration settings to verify the mechanism is configured in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.11.6.1.c If the mechanism functions are performed at an entity-defined frequency, examine the entity’s targeted risk analysis for determining the frequency to verify the risk analysis was performed in accordance with all elements specified at Requirement 12.3.1.11.6.1.d Examine configuration settings and interview personnel to verify the mechanism functions are performed either:• At least weeklyOR• At the frequency defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis performed for this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                         | PurposeMany web pages now rely on assembling objects, including active content (primarily JavaScript), from multiple internet locations. Additionally, the content of many web pages is defined using content management and tag management systems that may not be possible to monitor using traditional change detection mechanisms.Therefore, the only place to detect changes or indicators of malicious activity is in the consumer browser as the page is constructed and all JavaScript interpreted.By comparing the current version of the HTTP header and the active content of payment pages as received by the consumer browser with prior or known versions, it is possible to detect unauthorized changes that may indicate a skimming attack, or an attempt to disable a control designed to protect against, or to detect, skimming attacks.Additionally, by looking for known indicators of compromise and script elements or behavior typical of skimmers, suspicious alerts can be raised.(continued on next page)Good Practice Where an entity includes a TPSP’s/payment processor’s embedded payment page/form on its webpage, the entity should expect the TPSP/payment processor to provide evidence that the TPSP/payment processor is meeting this requirement, in accordance with the TPSP’s/payment processor’s PCI DSS assessment and Requirement 12.9. ExamplesMechanisms that detect and report on changes to the headers and content of the payment page could include, but are not limited to, a combination of the following techniques:• Violations of the Content Security Policy (CSP) can be reported to the entity using the report-to or report-uri CSP directives.• Changes to the CSP itself can indicate tampering.• External monitoring by systems that request and analyze the received web pages (also known as synthetic user monitoring) can detect changes to JavaScript in payment pages and alert personnel.• Embedding tamper-resistant, tamper-detection script in the payment page can alert and block when malicious script behavior is detected.• Reverse proxies and Content Delivery Networks can detect changes in scripts and alert personnel.The above list of mechanisms is not exhaustive, and the use of any one mechanism is not necessarily a full detection and reporting mechanism.Often, these mechanisms are subscription or cloud- based, but can also be based on custom and bespoke solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This policy sets forth the directives for the entire organization whereas individual security policies align and support the overall security policy and communicate specific objectives for technology or security disciplines.It is important that all relevant personnel within the organization, as well as relevant third parties, vendors, and business partners are aware of the organization’s information security policy and their responsibilities for protecting information assets.Definitions“Relevant” for this requirement means that the information security policy is disseminated to those with roles applicable to some or all the topics in the policy, either within the company or because of services/functions performed by a vendor or third party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Acceptable use policies outline the expected behavior from personnel when using the organization’s information technology and reflect the organization’s risk toleranceThese policies instruct personnel on what they can and cannot do with company equipment and instruct personnel on correct and incorrect uses of company Internet and email resources. Such policies can legally protect an organization and allow it to act when the policies are violated.Good PracticeIt is important that usage policies are supported by technical controls to manage the enforcement of the policies.Structuring polices as simple “do” and “do not” requirements that are linked to a purpose can help remove ambiguity and provide personnel with the context for the requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Performing this risk analysis according to a methodology ensures validity and consistency with policies and procedures.This targeted risk analysis (as opposed to a traditional enterprise-wide risk assessment) focuses on those PCI DSS requirements that allow an entity flexibility about how frequently an entity performs a given control. For this risk analysis, the entity carefully evaluates each PCI DSS requirement that provides this flexibility and determines the frequency that supports adequate security for the entity, and the level of risk the entity is willing to accept.The risk analysis identifies the specific assets, such as the system components and data—for example, log files, or credentials—that the requirement is intended to protect, as well as the threat(s) or outcomes that the requirement is protecting the assets from—for example, malware, an undetected intruder, or misuse of credentials. Examples of factors that could contribute to likelihood or impact include any that could increase the vulnerability of an asset to a threat—for example, exposure to untrusted networks, complexity of environment, or high staff turnover—as well as the criticality of the system components, or volume and sensitivity of the data, being protected.(continued on next page)Reviewing the results of these targeted risk analyses at least once every 12 months and upon changes that could impact the risk to the environment allows the organization to ensure the risk analysis results remain current with organizational changes and evolving threats, trends, and technologies, and that the selected frequencies still adequately address the entity’s risk.Good PracticeAn enterprise-wide risk assessment, which is a point-in-time activity that enables entities to identify threats and associated vulnerabilities, is recommended, but is not required, for entities to determine and understand broader and emerging threats with the potential to negatively impact its business. This enterprise-wide risk assessment could be established as part of an overarching risk management program that is used as an input to the annual review of an organization's overall information security policy (see Requirement 12.1.1).Examples of risk-assessment methodologies for enterprise-wide risk assessments include, but are not limited to, ISO 27005 and NIST SP 800-30.Further InformationRefer to the following documents on the PCI SSC website:• Information Supplement: TRA Guidance• Sample Template: TRA for Activity Frequency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

These controls are expected to at least meet or exceed the security provided by the defined requirement and require extensive documentation by the entity using the customized approach.Further InformationSee Appendix D: Customized Approach for instructions on how to document the required evidence for the customized approach.See PCI DSS v4.x: Sample Templates to Support Customized Approach on the PCI SSC website for templates that entities may use to document their customized controls. Note that while use of the templates is optional, the information specified within each template must be documented and provided to each entity’s assessor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12.3.3    | Defined Approach Requirements12.3.3 Cryptographic cipher suites and protocols in use are documented and reviewed at least once every 12 months, including at least the following:• An up-to-date inventory of all cryptographic cipher suites and protocols in use, including purpose and where used.• Active monitoring of industry trends regarding continued viability of all cryptographic cipher suites and protocols in use.• Documentation of a plan, to respond to anticipated changes in cryptographic vulnerabilities.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe entity is able to respond quickly to any vulnerabilities in cryptographic protocols or algorithms, where those vulnerabilities affect protection of cardholder data.Applicability NotesThe requirement applies to all cryptographic cipher suites and protocols used to meet PCI DSS requirements, including, but not limited to, those used to render PAN unreadable in storage and transmission, to protect passwords, and as part of authenticating access.This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Defined Approach Testing Procedures12.3.3 Examine documentation for cryptographic suites and protocols in use and interview personnel to verify the documentation and review is in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | PurposeProtocols and encryption strengths may quickly change or be deprecated due to identification of vulnerabilities or design flaws. In order to support current and future data security needs, entities need to know where cryptography is used and understand how they would be able to respond rapidly to changes impacting the strength of their cryptographic implementations. Good PracticeCryptographic agility is important to ensure an alternative to the original encryption method or cryptographic primitive is available, with plans to upgrade to the alternative without significant change to system infrastructure. For example, if the entity is aware of when protocols or algorithms will be deprecated by standards bodies, proactive plans will help the entity to upgrade before the deprecation is impactful to operations.Definitions“Cryptographic agility” refers to the ability to monitor and manage the encryption and related verification technologies deployed across an organization.Further InformationRefer to NIST SP 800-131a, Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Lengths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 12.3.4    | Defined Approach Requirements12.3.4 Hardware and software technologies in use are reviewed at least once every 12 months, including at least the following:• Analysis that the technologies continue to receive security fixes from vendors promptly.• Analysis that the technologies continue to support (and do not preclude) the entity’s PCI DSS compliance.• Documentation of any industry announcements or trends related to a technology, such as when a vendor has announced “end of life” plans for a technology.• Documentation of a plan, approved by senior management, to remediate outdated technologies, including those for which vendors have announced “end of life” plans.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe entity’s hardware and software technologies are up to date and supported by the vendor. Plans to remove or replace all unsupported system components are reviewed periodically.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Defined Approach Testing Procedures12.3.4 Examine documentation for the review of hardware and software technologies in use and interview personnel to verify that the review is in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | PurposeHardware and software technologies are constantly evolving, and organizations need to be aware of changes to the technologies they use, as well as the evolving threats to those technologies to ensure that they can prepare for, and manage, vulnerabilities in hardware and software that will not be remediated by the vendor or developer. Good PracticeOrganizations should review firmware versions to ensure they remain current and supported by the vendors. Organizations also need to be aware of changes made by technology vendors to their products or processes to understand how such changes may impact the organization’s use of the technology.Regular reviews of technologies that impact or influence PCI DSS controls can assist with purchasing, usage, and deployment strategies, and ensure controls that rely on those technologies remain effective. These reviews include, but are not limited to, reviewing technologies that are no longer supported by the vendor and/or no longer meet the security needs of the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 12.4.2    | Defined Approach Requirements12.4.2 Additional requirement for service providers only: Reviews are performed at least once every three months to confirm that personnel are performing their tasks in accordance with all security policies and operational procedures. Reviews are performed by personnel other than those responsible for performing the given task and include, but are not limited to, the following tasks:• Daily log reviews.• Configuration reviews for network security controls.• Applying configuration standards to new systems.• Responding to security alerts.• Change-management processes.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe operational effectiveness of critical PCI DSS controls is verified periodically by manual inspection of records.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Defined Approach Testing Procedures12.4.2.a Additional testing procedure for service provider assessments only: Examine policies and procedures to verify that processes are defined for conducting reviews to confirm that personnel are performing their tasks in accordance with all security policies and all operational procedures, including but not limited to the tasks specified in this requirement.12.4.2.b Additional testing procedure for service provider assessments only: Interview responsible personnel and examine records of reviews to verify that reviews are performed:• At least once every three months.• By personnel other than those responsible for performing the given task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | PurposeRegularly confirming that security policies and procedures are being followed provides assurance that the expected controls are active and working as intended. This requirement is distinct from other requirements that specify a task to be performed. The objective of these reviews is not to reperform other PCI DSS requirements, but to confirm that security activities are being performed on an ongoing basis.Good PracticeThese reviews can also be used to verify that appropriate evidence is being maintained—for example, audit logs, vulnerability scan reports, reviews of network security control rulesets—to assist in the entity’s preparation for its next PCI DSS assessment.ExamplesLooking at Requirement 1.2.7 as one example, Requirement 12.4.2 is met by confirming, at least once every three months, that reviews of configurations of network security controls have occurred at the required frequency. On the other hand, Requirement 1.2.7 is met by reviewing those configurations as specified in the requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 12.5.2    | Defined Approach Requirements12.5.2 PCI DSS scope is documented and confirmed by the entity at least once every 12 months and upon significant change to the in-scope environment. At a minimum, the scoping validation includes:• Identifying all data flows for the various payment stages (for example, authorization, capture settlement, chargebacks, and refunds) and acceptance channels (for example, card- present, card-not-present, and e-commerce).• Updating all data-flow diagrams per Requirement 1.2.4.• Identifying all locations where account data is stored, processed, and transmitted, including but not limited to: 1) any locations outside of the currently defined CDE, 2) applications that process CHD, 3) transmissions between systems and networks, and 4) file backups.• Identifying all system components in the CDE, connected to the CDE, or that could impact security of the CDE.• Identifying all segmentation controls in use and the environment(s) from which the CDE is segmented, including justification for environments being out of scope.• Identifying all connections from third-party entities with access to the CDE.• Confirming that all identified data flows, account data, system components, segmentation controls, and connections from third parties with access to the CDE are included in scope.Customized Approach ObjectivePCI DSS scope is verified periodically, and after significant changes, by comprehensive analysis and appropriate technical measures.Applicability NotesThis annual confirmation of PCI DSS scope is an activity expected to be performed by the entity under assessment, and is not the same, nor is it intended to be replaced by, the scoping confirmation performed by the entity’s assessor during the annual assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Defined Approach Testing Procedures12.5.2.a Examine documented results of scope reviews and interview personnel to verify that the reviews are performed:• At least once every 12 months.• After significant changes to the in-scope environment.12.5.2.b Examine documented results of scope reviews performed by the entity to verify that PCI DSS scoping confirmation activity includes all elements specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | PurposeFrequent validation of PCI DSS scope helps to ensure PCI DSS scope remains up to date and aligned with changing business objectives, and therefore that security controls are protecting all appropriate system components.Good PracticeAccurate scoping involves critically evaluating the CDE and all connected system components to determine the necessary coverage for PCI DSS requirements. Scoping activities, including careful analysis and ongoing monitoring, help to ensure that in-scope systems are appropriately secured. When documenting account data locations, the entity can consider creating a table or spreadsheet that includes the following information:• Data stores (databases, files, cloud, etc.), including the purpose of data storage and the retention period,• Which CHD elements are stored (PAN, expiry date, cardholder name, and/or any elements of SAD prior to completion of authorization),• How data is secured (type of encryption and strength, hashing algorithm and strength, truncation, tokenization),• How access to data stores is logged, including a description of logging mechanism(s) in use (enterprise solution, application level, operating system level, etc.).(continued on next page)In addition to internal systems and networks, all connections from third-party entities—for example, business partners, entities providing remote support services, and other service providers—need to be identified to determine inclusion for PCI DSS scope. Once the in-scope connections have been identified, the applicable PCI DSS controls can be implemented to reduce the risk of a third-party connection being used to compromise an entity’s CDE.A data discovery tool or methodology can be used to facilitate identifying all sources and locations of PAN, and to look for PAN that resides on systems and networks outside the currently defined CDE or in unexpected places within the defined CDE— for example, in an error log or memory dump file. This approach can help ensure that previously unknown locations of PAN are detected and that the PAN is either eliminated or properly secured.Further InformationFor additional guidance, refer to Information Supplement: Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 12.5.2.1  | Defined Approach Requirements12.5.2.1 Additional requirement for service providers only: PCI DSS scope is documented and confirmed by the entity at least once every six months and upon significant change to the in-scope environment.

Service providers also typically have larger and more complex networks that are subject to more frequent change. The probability of overlooked changes to scope in complex and dynamic networks is greater in service-providers environments.Validating PCI DSS scope more frequently is likely to discover such overlooked changes before they can be exploited by an attacker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Therefore, it is important to revisit PCI DSS scope and controls when there are changes to an organization’s structure and management to ensure controls are in place and active.ExamplesChanges to organizational structure include, but are not limited to, company mergers or acquisitions, and significant changes or reassignments of personnel with responsibility for security controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

For example, positions requiring greater responsibility or that have administrative access to critical data or systems may warrant more detailed or more frequent screening than positions with less responsibility and access.ExamplesScreening options can include, as appropriate for the entity’s region, previous employment history, review of public information/social media resources, criminal record, credit history, and reference checks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 12.8.2    | Defined Approach Requirements12.8.2 Written agreements with TPSPs are maintained as follows:• Written agreements are maintained with all TPSPs with which account data is shared or that could affect the security of the CDE.• Written agreements include acknowledgments from TPSPs that TPSPs are responsible for the security of account data the TPSPs possess or otherwise store, process, or transmit on behalf of the entity, or to the extent that the TPSP could impact the security of the entity’s cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data.Customized Approach ObjectiveRecords are maintained of each TPSP’s acknowledgment of its responsibility to protect account data.Applicability NotesThe exact wording of an agreement will depend on the details of the service being provided, and the responsibilities assigned to each party. The agreement does not have to include the exact wording provided in this requirement.The TPSP’s written acknowledgment is a confirmation that states the TPSP is responsible for the security of the account data it may store, process, or transmit on behalf of the customer or to the extent the TPSP may impact the security of a customer’s cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data.Evidence that a TPSP is meeting PCI DSS requirements (is not the same as a written acknowledgment specified in this requirement. For example, a PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC), a declaration on a company’s website, a policy statement, a responsibility matrix, or other evidence not included in a written agreement is not a written acknowledgment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Defined Approach Testing Procedures12.8.2.a Examine policies and procedures to verify that processes are defined to maintain written agreements with all TPSPs in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.12.8.2.b Examine written agreements with TPSPs to verify they are maintained in accordance with all elements as specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | PurposeThe written acknowledgment from a TPSP demonstrates its commitment to maintaining proper security of account data that it obtains from its customers and that the TPSP is fully aware of the assets that could be affected during the provisioning of the TPSP’s service. The extent to which a specific TPSP is responsible for the security of account data will depend on the service provided and the responsibilities agreed between the provider and assessed entity (the customer).In conjunction with Requirement 12.9.1, this requirement is intended to promote a consistent level of understanding between parties about their applicable PCI DSS responsibilities. For example, the agreement may include the applicable PCI DSS requirements to be maintained as part of the provided service.Good PracticeThe entity may also want to consider including in their written agreement with a TPSP that the TPSP will support the entity’s request for information per Requirement 12.9.2. Entities will also want to understand whether any TPSPs have “nested” relationships with other TPSPs, meaning the primary TPSP contracts with another TPSP(s) for the purposes of providing a service.It is important to understand whether the primary TPSP is relying on the secondary TPSP(s) to achieve overall compliance of a service, and what types of written agreements the primary TPSP has in place with the secondary TPSPs.

Elements that should be considered include the provider’s reporting practices, breach-notification and incident response procedures, details of how PCI DSS responsibilities are assigned between each party, how the TPSP validates their PCI DSS compliance and what evidence they provide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 12.8.4    | Defined Approach Requirements12.8.4 A program is implemented to monitor TPSPs’ PCI DSS compliance status at least once every 12 months.Customized Approach ObjectiveThe PCI DSS compliance status of TPSPs is verified periodically.Applicability NotesWhere an entity has an agreement with a TPSP for meeting PCI DSS requirements on behalf of the entity (for example, via a firewall service), the entity must work with the TPSP to make sure the applicable PCI DSS requirements are met.

For example, the TPSP can provide specific evidence to the entity’s assessor so the assessor can confirm applicable requirements are met. Alternatively, the TPSP can elect to undergo multiple on-demand assessments by each of its customers’ assessors, with each assessment targeted to confirm that applicable requirements are met.Further InformationFor more information about third-party service providers, refer to:• PCI DSS section: Use of Third-Party Service Providers.• Information Supplement: Third-Party Security Assurance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

This type of document is often referred to as a responsibility matrix.(continued on next page)It is also important for entities to understand whether any TPSPs have “nested” relationships with other TPSPs, meaning the primary TPSP contracts with another TPSP(s) for the purposes of providing a service. It is important to understand whether the primary TPSP is relying on the secondary TPSP(s) to achieve overall compliance of a service, and how the primary TPSP is monitoring performance of the service and the PCI DSS compliance status of the secondary TPSP(s). Note that it is the responsibility of the primary TPSP to manage and monitor any secondary TPSPs.Further InformationRefer to Information Supplement: Third-Party Security Assurance for a sample responsibility matrix template.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 12.9.1    | Defined Approach Requirements12.9.1 Additional requirement for service providers only: TPSPs provide written agreements to customers that include acknowledgments that TPSPs are responsible for the security of account data the TPSP possesses or otherwise stores, processes, or transmits on behalf of the customer, or to the extent that the TPSP could impact the security of the customer’s cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data.Customized Approach ObjectiveTPSPs formally acknowledge their security responsibilities to their customers.(continued on next page)Applicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.The exact wording of an agreement will depend on the details of the service being provided, and the responsibilities assigned to each party. The agreement does not have to include the exact wording provided in this requirement.The TPSP’s written acknowledgment is a confirmation that states the TPSP is responsible for the security of the account data it may store, process, or transmit on behalf of the customer or to the extent the TPSP may impact the security of a customer’s cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data.Evidence that a TPSP is meeting PCI DSS requirements is not the same as a written agreement specified in this requirement. For example, a PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC), a declaration on a company’s website, a policy statement, a responsibility matrix, or other evidence not included in a written agreement is not a written acknowledgment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Defined Approach Testing Procedures12.9.1 Additional testing procedure for service provider assessments only: Examine TPSP policies, procedures, and templates used for written agreements to verify processes are defined for the TPSP to provide written acknowledgments to customers in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | PurposeIn conjunction with Requirement 12.8.2, this requirement is intended to promote a consistent level of understanding between TPSPs and their customers about their applicable PCI DSS responsibilities. The acknowledgment from the TPSP evidences the TPSP’s commitment to maintaining proper security of the account data that it obtains from its customers.The TPSP’s internal policies and procedures related to their customer engagement process and any templates used for written agreements should include provision of an applicable PCI DSS acknowledgement to its customers. The method by which the TPSP provides written acknowledgment should be agreed between the provider and its customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 12.9.2    | Defined Approach Requirements12.9.2 Additional requirement for service providers only: TPSPs support their customers’ requests for information to meet Requirements 12.8.4 and 12.8.5 by providing the following upon customer request:• PCI DSS compliance status information (Requirement 12.8.4).• Information about which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the TPSP and which are the responsibility of the customer, including any shared responsibilities (Requirement 12.8.5), for any service the TPSP provides that meets a PCI DSS requirement(s) on behalf of customers or that can impact security of customers’ cardholder data or sensitive authentication data.Customized Approach ObjectiveTPSPs provide information as needed to support their customers’ PCI DSS compliance efforts.Applicability NotesThis requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.12.9.2 (continued)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Defined Approach Testing Procedures12.9.2 Additional testing procedure for service provider assessments only: Examine policies and procedures to verify processes are defined for the TPSPs to support customers’ request for information to meet Requirements 12.8.4 and 12.8.5 in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | PurposeIf a TPSP does not provide the necessary information to enable its customers to meet their security and compliance requirements, the customers will not be able to protect cardholder data nor meet their own contractual obligations.Good PracticeIf a TPSP has a PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC), the expectation is that the TPSP should provide that to customers upon request to demonstrate their PCI DSS compliance status.If the TPSP did not undergo a PCI DSS assessment, they may be able to provide other sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it has met the applicable requirements without undergoing a formal compliance validation. For example, the TPSP can provide specific evidence to the entity’s assessor so the assessor can confirm applicable requirements are met. Alternatively, the TPSP can elect to undergo multiple on-demand assessments by each of its customers’ assessors, with each assessment targeted to confirm that applicable requirements are met.TPSPs should provide sufficient evidence to their customers to verify that the scope of the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment covered the services applicable to the customer and that the relevant PCI DSS requirements were examined and determined to be in place.(continued on next page)TPSPs may define their PCI DSS responsibilities to be the same for all their customers; otherwise, this responsibility should be agreed upon by both the customer and TPSP. It is important that the customer understands which PCI DSS requirements and sub-requirements its TPSPs have agreed to meet, which requirements are shared between the TPSP and the customer, and for those that are shared, specifics about how the requirements are shared and which entity is responsible for meeting each sub-requirement. An example of a way to document these responsibilities is via a matrix that identifies all applicable PCI DSS requirements and indicates whether the customer or TPSP is responsible for meeting that requirement or whether it is a shared responsibility.Further InformationFor further guidance, refer to:• PCI DSS section: Use of Third-Party Service Providers.• Information Supplement: Third-Party Security Assurance (includes a sample responsibility matrix template).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 12.10.1   | Defined Approach Requirements12.10.1 An incident response plan exists and is ready to be activated in the event of a suspected or confirmed security incident. The plan includes, but is not limited to:• Roles, responsibilities, and communication and contact strategies in the event of a suspected or confirmed security incident, including notification of payment brands and acquirers, at a minimum.• Incident response procedures with specific containment and mitigation activities for different types of incidents.• Business recovery and continuity procedures.• Data backup processes.• Analysis of legal requirements for reporting compromises.• Coverage and responses of all critical system components.• Reference or inclusion of incident response procedures from the payment brands.Customized Approach ObjectiveA comprehensive incident response plan that meets card brand expectations is maintained.12.10.1 (continued)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Defined Approach Testing Procedures12.10.1.a Examine the incident response plan to verify that the plan exists and includes at least the elements specified in this requirement.12.10.1.b Interview personnel and examine documentation from previously reported incidents or alerts to verify that the documented incident response plan and procedures were followed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | PurposeWithout a comprehensive incident response plan that is properly disseminated, read, and understood by the parties responsible, confusion and lack of a unified response could create further downtime for the business, unnecessary public media exposure, as well as risk of financial and/or reputational loss and legal liabilities.Good PracticeThe incident response plan should be thorough and contain all the key elements for stakeholders (for example, legal, communications) to allow the entity to respond effectively in the event of a breach that could impact account data. It is important to keep the plan up to date with current contact information of all individuals designated as having a role in incident response. Other relevant parties for notifications may include customers, financial institutions (acquirers and issuers), and business partners.Entities should consider how to address all compromises of data within the CDE in their incident response plans, including compromises to account data, wireless encryption keys, encryption keys used for transmission and storage or account data or cardholder data, etc.(continued on next page)ExamplesLegal requirements for reporting compromises include those in most US states, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Personal Data Protection Act (Singapore).Further InformationFor more information, refer to the NIST SP 800- 61 Rev. 2, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Periodic testing of the plan ensures that the processes remain viable, as well as ensuring that all relevant personnel in the organization are familiar with the plan.Good PracticeThe test of the incident response plan can include simulated incidents and the corresponding responses in the form of a “table-top exercise” that includes participation by relevant personnel. A review of the incident and the quality of the response can provide entities with the assurance that all required elements are included in the plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The incident response team can consist of core members who are permanently assigned or “on-demand” personnel who may be called up as necessary, depending on their expertise and the specifics of the incident.Having available resources to respond quickly to incidents minimizes disruption to the organization.Examples of types of activity the team or individuals should respond to include any evidence of unauthorized activity, detection of unauthorized wireless access points, critical IDS alerts, and reports of unauthorized critical system or content file changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Although it is often included as part of the review of the entire incident, it should focus on how the entity’s response to the incident could be improved.It is important to not just consider elements of the response that did not have the planned outcomes but also to understand what worked well and whether lessons from those elements that worked well can be applied to areas of the plan that did not.Another way to optimize an entity’s incident response plan is to understand the attacks made against other organizations and use that information to fine-tune the entity’s detection, containment, mitigation, or recovery procedures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 12.10.7   | Defined Approach Requirements12.10.7 Incident response procedures are in place, to be initiated upon the detection of stored PAN anywhere it is not expected, and include:• Determining what to do if PAN is discovered outside the CDE, including its retrieval, secure deletion, and/or migration into the currently defined CDE, as applicable.• Identifying whether sensitive authentication data is stored with PAN.• Determining where the account data came from and how it ended up where it was not expected.• Remediating data leaks or process gaps that resulted in the account data being where it was not expected.Customized Approach ObjectiveProcesses are in place to quickly respond, analyze, and address situations in the event that cleartext PAN is detected where it is not expected.Applicability NotesThis requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.Appendix A Additional PCI DSS RequirementsThis appendix contains additional PCI DSS requirements for different types of entities.

If such contributory factors are present, they should be addressed per this Requirement to prevent recurrence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

In addition, multi-tenant service providers must meet the requirements in this Appendix. Multi-tenant service providers are a type of third-party service provider that offers various shared services to merchants and other service providers, where customers share system resources (such as physical or virtual servers), infrastructure, applications (including Software as a Service (SaaS)), and/or databases. Services may include, but are not limited to, hosting multiple entities on a single shared server, providing e-commerce and/or “shopping cart” services, web- based hosting services, payment applications, various cloud applications and services, and payment gateway and processor services offered in a shared environment. Service providers that provide only shared data center services (often called co-location or “co-lo” providers), where equipment, space, and bandwidth are available on a rental basis, are not considered multi-tenant service providers for purposes of this Appendix. Note: Even though a multi-tenant service provider may meet these requirements, each customer is still responsible to comply with the PCI DSS requirements that are applicable to its environment and validate compliance as applicable. Often, there are PCI DSS requirements for which responsibility is shared between the provider and the customer (for perhaps different aspects of the environment). Requirements 12.8 and 12.9 delineate requirements specific to the relationships between all third-party service providers (TPSPs) and their customers, and the responsibilities of both. This includes defining the specific services the customer is receiving, along with which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the customer to meet, which are the responsibility of the TPSP, and which requirements are shared between both customer and the TPSP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

environment, a malicious actor within the provider’s environment could compromise the customer’s environment, and similarly, a malicious actor in a customer environment could compromise the provider and potentially other of the provider’s customers.Multi-tenant environments should be isolated from each other and from the provider’s infrastructure such that they can be separately managed entities with no connectivity between them.Good PracticeProviders should ensure strong separation between the environments that are designed for customer access, for example, configuration and billing portals, and the provider’s private environment that should only be accessed by authorized provider personnel.Service provider access to customer environments is performed in accordance with requirement

controls are effective, it is possible that changes to the service provider’s technology would inadvertently create a vulnerability that could be exploited across all the service provider’s customers.Good PracticeEffectiveness of separation techniques can be confirmed by using service-provider-created temporary (mock-up) environments that represent customer environments and attempting to 1) access one temporary environment from another environment, and 2) access a temporary environment from the Internet.

Entities using SSL and early TLS for POS POI terminal connections must work toward upgrading to a strong cryptographic protocol as soon as possible. Additionally, SSL and/or early TLS must not be introduced into environments where those protocols don’t already exist. At the time of publication, the known vulnerabilities are difficult to exploit in POS POI payment terminals. However, new vulnerabilities could emerge at any time, and it is up to the organization to remain up to date with vulnerability trends and determine whether it is susceptible to any known exploits. The PCI DSS requirements directly affected are: • Requirement 2.2.5: Where any insecure services, protocols, or daemons are present; business justification is documented, and additional security features are documented and implemented that reduce the risk of using insecure services, protocols, or daemons. • Requirement 2.2.7: All non-console administrative access is encrypted using strong cryptography. • Requirement 4.2.1: Strong cryptography and security protocols are implemented to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks. SSL and early TLS must not be used as a security control to meet these requirements, except in the case of POS POI terminal connections, as detailed in this appendix. To support entities working to migrate from SSL/early TLS on POS POI terminals, the following provisions are included: • New POS POI terminal implementations must not use SSL or early TLS as a security control. • All POS POI terminal service providers must provide a secure service offering. • Service providers supporting existing POS POI terminal implementations that use SSL and/or early TLS must have a formal Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan in place. • POS POI terminals in card-present environments that can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits for SSL and early TLS, and the SSL/TLS termination points to which they connect, may continue using SSL/early TLS as a security control. Requirements in this Appendix are not eligible for the Customized Approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| A2.1.1    | Defined Approach RequirementsA2.1.1 Where POS POI terminals at the merchant or payment acceptance location use SSL and/or early TLS, the entity confirms the devices are not susceptible to any known exploits for those protocols.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.Applicability NotesThis requirement is intended to apply to the entity with the POS POI terminal, such as a merchant. This requirement is not intended for service providers who serve as the termination or connection point to those POS POI terminals. Requirements A2.1.2 and A2.1.3 apply to POS POI service providers.The allowance for POS POI terminals that are not currently susceptible to exploits is based on currently known risks. If new exploits are introduced to which POS POI terminals are susceptible, the POS POI terminals will need to be updated immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Defined Approach Testing ProceduresA2.1.1 For POS POI terminals using SSL and/or early TLS, confirm the entity has documentation (for example, vendor documentation, system/network configuration details) that verifies the devices are not susceptible to any known exploits for SSL/early TLS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | PurposePOS POI terminals used in card-present environments can continue using SSL/early TLS when it can be shown that the POS POI terminal is not susceptible to the currently known exploits.Good PracticeHowever, SSL is outdated technology and could be susceptible to additional security vulnerabilities in the future; it is therefore strongly recommended that POS POI terminals be upgraded to a secure protocol as soon as possible. If SSL/early TLS is not needed in the environment, use of, and fallback to these versions should be disabled.Further InformationRefer to the current PCI SSC Information Supplements on SSL/Early TLS for further guidance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

TLS when it can be shown that the service provider has controls in place that mitigate the risk of supporting those connections for the service provider environment.Good PracticeService providers should communicate to all customers using SSL/early TLS about the risks associated with its use and the need to migrate to a secure protocol.DefinitionsThe Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan is a document prepared by the entity that details its plans for migrating to a secure protocol and describes controls the entity has in place to reduce the risk associated with SSL/early TLS until the migration is complete.Further InformationRefer to the current PCI SSC Information Supplements on SSL/early TLS for further guidance on Risk Mitigation and Migration Plans.

In many cases, customers will need to take a phased or gradual approach to migrate their POS POI estate from the insecure protocol to a secure protocol and so will require the service provider to support a secure offering.Further InformationRefer to the current PCI SSC Information Supplements on SSL/Early TLS for further guidance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

An entity is required to undergo an assessment according to this Appendix ONLY if instructed to do so by an acquirer or a payment brand. Examples of entities that this Appendix could apply to include: • Those storing, processing, and/or transmitting large volumes of account data, • Those providing aggregation points for account data, or • Those that have suffered significant or repeated breaches of account data. Additionally, other PCI standards may reference completion of this Appendix. These supplemental validation steps are intended to provide greater assurance that PCI DSS controls are maintained effectively and on a continuous basis through validation of business-as-usual (BAU) processes and increased validation and scoping consideration. (continued on next page) (continued) Note: Some PCI DSS requirements in this Appendix have defined timeframes (for example, an activity that is to be performed at least once every three months or six months). For an initial assessment to such requirements, it is not required that an activity has been performed for every such timeframe during the previous year, if the assessor verifies: • The activity was performed in accordance with the applicable requirement within the most recent timeframe (for example, the most recent three-month or six-month period), and • The entity has documented policies and procedures for continuing to perform the activity within the defined timeframe. For subsequent years after the initial assessment, an activity must have been performed within each required timeframe. For example, an activity required at least every three months must have been performed at least four times during the previous year at an interval that does not exceed 90-92 days. Refer to section 7 Descriptions of Timeframes Used in PCI DSS Requirements for additional guidance about initial assessments. Not all requirements in PCI DSS apply to all entities that may undergo a PCI DSS assessment. It is for this reason that some PCI DSS Requirements are duplicated in this appendix. Any questions about this appendix should be addressed to acquirers or payment brands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

effectively communicate activities and compliance status throughout the organization.Good PracticeThe PCI DSS compliance program can be a dedicated program or part of overarching compliance and/or governance program, and should include a well-defined methodology that demonstrates consistent and effective evaluation.Strategic business decisions that should be analyzed for potential PCI DSS impacts may include mergers and acquisitions, new technology purchases, or new payment-acceptance channels.DefinitionsMaintaining and monitoring an organization’s overall PCI DSS compliance includes identifying activities to be performed daily, weekly, monthly, every three months, or annually, and ensuring these activities are being performed accordingly (for example, using a security self-assessment or PDCA methodology).ExamplesMethodologies that support the management of compliance programs include Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA), ISO 27001, COBIT, DMAIC, and Six Sigma.

Training content should be applicable for the individual’s job function, be current, and include the latest security threats and/or version of PCI DSS.Further InformationFor additional guidance, refer to Information Supplement: Best Practices for Implementing a Security Awareness Program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| A3.2.1    | Defined Approach RequirementsA3.2.1 PCI DSS scope is documented and confirmed for accuracy at least once every three months and upon significant changes to the in- scope environment. At a minimum, the scoping validation includes:• Identifying all data flows for the various payment stages (for example, authorization, capture, settlement, chargebacks, and refunds) and acceptance channels (for example, card- present, card-not-present, and e-commerce).• Updating all data-flow diagrams per Requirement 1.2.4.• Identifying all locations where account data is stored, processed, and transmitted, including but not limited to 1) any locations outside of the currently defined CDE, 2) applications that process CHD, 3) transmissions between systems and networks, and 4) file backups.• For any account data found outside of the currently defined CDE, either 1) securely delete it, 2) migrate it into the currently defined CDE, or 3) expand the currently defined CDE to include it.• Identifying all system components in the CDE, connected to the CDE, or that could impact security of the CDE.(continued on next page)• Identifying all segmentation controls in use and the environment(s) from which the CDE is segmented, including justification for environments being out of scope• Identifying all connections to third-party entities with access to the CDE.• Confirming that all identified data flows, account data, system components, segmentation controls, and connections from third parties with access to the CDE are included in scope.PCI DSS Reference: Scope of PCI DSS Requirements, Requirement 12.Customized Approach ObjectiveThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Defined Approach Testing ProceduresA3.2.1.a Examine documented results of scope reviews and interview personnel to verify that the reviews are performed:• At least once every three months.• After significant changes to the in-scope environment.A3.2.1.b Examine documented results of scope reviews occurring at least once every three months to verify that scoping validation includes all elements specified in this requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | PurposeFrequent validation of PCI DSS scope helps to ensure PCI DSS scope remains up to date and aligned with changing business objectives, and therefore that security controls are protecting all appropriate system components.Good PracticeAccurate scoping involves critically evaluating the CDE and all connected system components to determine the necessary coverage for PCI DSS requirements. Scoping activities, including careful analysis and ongoing monitoring, help to ensure that in-scope systems are appropriately secured. When documenting account data locations, the entity can consider creating a table or spreadsheet that includes the following information:• Data stores (databases, files, cloud, etc.), including purpose of data storage and the retention period,• Which CHD elements are stored (PAN, expiry date, cardholder name, and/or any elements of SAD prior to completion of authorization),• How data is secured (type of encryption and strength, hashing algorithm and strength, truncation, tokenization),• How access to data stores is logged, including a description of logging mechanism(s) in use (enterprise solution, application level, operating system level, etc.).(continued on next page)In addition to internal systems and networks, all connections from third-party entities—for example, business partners, entities providing remote support services, and other service providers—need to be identified to determine inclusion for PCI DSS scope. Once the in-scope connections have been identified, the applicable PCI DSS controls can be implemented to reduce the risk of a third-party connection being used to compromise an entity’s CDE.A data discovery tool or methodology can be used to facilitate identifying all sources and locations of PAN, and to look for PAN that resides on systems and networks outside the currently defined CDE or in unexpected places within the defined CDE— for example, in an error log or memory dump file. This approach can help ensure that previously unknown locations of PAN are detected and that the PAN is either eliminated or properly secured.Further InformationRefer to Information Supplement: Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation for additional guidance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

For example, changes to network security control rulesets can bring whole network segments into scope, or new systems may be added to the CDE that have to be appropriately protected.A formal impact assessment performed in advance of a change gives the entity assurance that the change will not adversely affect the security of the CDE.Good PracticeProcesses to determine the potential impact that changes to systems and networks may have on an entity’s PCI DSS scope may be performed as part of a dedicated PCI DSS compliance program or may fall under an entity’s overarching compliance and/or governance program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

systems or networks added to the in-scope environment due to a change.Building this validation into change management processes helps ensure that device inventories and configuration standards are kept up to date, and security controls are applied where needed.Good PracticeA change management process should include supporting evidence that PCI DSS requirements are implemented or preserved through an iterative process.ExamplesPCI DSS requirements that should be verified include, but are not limited to:• Network diagrams are updated to reflect changes.• Systems are configured per configuration standards, with all default passwords changed and unnecessary services disabled.• Systems are protected with required controls—for example, file integrity monitoring, antimalware, patches, and audit logging.• Sensitive authentication data is not stored, and all account data storage is documented and incorporated into data-retention policy and procedures.• New systems are included in the quarterly vulnerability scanning process.

Changes to this structure could have negative effects to existing controls and frameworks by reallocating or removing resources that once supported PCI DSS controls or inheriting new responsibilities that may not have established controls in place. Therefore, it is important to revisit PCI DSS scope and controls when there are changes to an organization’s structure and management to ensure controls are in place and active.ExamplesChanges to organizational structure include, but are not limited to, company mergers or acquisitions, and significant changes or reassignments of personnel with responsibility for security control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

                                     | PurposePCI DSS normally requires segmentation controls to be verified by penetration testing every twelve months.Validating segmentation controls more frequently is likely to discover failings in segmentation before they can be exploited by an attacker attempting to pivot laterally from an out-of-scope untrusted network to the CDE.Good PracticeAlthough the requirement specifies that this scope validation is carried out at least once every six months and after a significant change, this exercise should be performed as frequently as possible to ensure it remains effective at isolating the CDE from other networks.Further InformationRefer to Information Supplement: Penetration Testing Guidance for additional guidance.

Implementing a data- discovery methodology that identifies all sources and locations of cleartext PAN and looks for cleartext PAN on systems and networks outside the currently defined CDE or in unexpected places within the defined CDE—for example, in an error log or memory dump file— helps to ensure that previously unknown locations of cleartext PAN are detected and properly secured.ExamplesA data-discovery process can be performed via a variety of methods, including, but not limited to 1) commercially available data-discovery software, 2) an in-house developed data-discovery program, or 3) a manual search. A combination of methodologies may also be used as needed.Regardless of the method used, the goal of the effort is to find all sources and locations of cleartext PAN (not just in the defined CDE).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

If such contributory factors are present, they should be addressed per this Requirement to prevent a recurrence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

                                        | PurposeThe use of mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized PAN from leaving the CDE allows an organization to detect and prevent situations that may lead to data loss.Good PracticeCoverage of the mechanisms should include, but not be limited to, e-mails, downloads to removable media, and output to printers.ExamplesMechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized loss of cleartext PAN may include the use of appropriate tools such as data loss prevention (DLP) solutions as well as manual processes and procedures.

In addition, without formalized time- bound processes, attackers will have ample time to compromise systems and steal account data from the CDE.Good PracticeThe specific types of failures may vary, depending on the function of the device system component and technology in use. Typical failures include a system ceasing to perform its security function or not functioning in its intended manner, such as a firewall erasing all its rules or going offline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Conducting appropriate reviews of these technologies ensures that they can prepare for, and manage, vulnerabilities in hardware and software that will not be remediated by the vendor or developer.Good PracticeOrganizations should also consider reviewing firmware versions to ensure they remain current and supported by the vendors.Organizations also need to be aware of changes made by technology vendors to their products or processes to understand how such changes may impact the organization’s use of the technology.Regular reviews of technologies that impact or influence PCI DSS controls can assist with purchasing, usage, and deployment strategies and ensure controls that rely on those technologies remain effective. These reviews include, but are not limited to, reviewing technologies that are no longer supported by the vendor and/or no longer meet the security needs of the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The objective of these reviews is not to reperform other PCI DSS requirements, but to confirm that security activities are being performed on an ongoing basis.Good PracticeThese reviews can also be used to verify that appropriate evidence is being maintained—for example, audit logs, vulnerability scan reports, reviews of network security control rulesets—to assist in the entity’s preparation for its next PCI DSS assessment.ExamplesLooking at Requirement 1.2.7 as one example, Requirement A3.3.3 is met by confirming, at least once every three months, that reviews of configurations of network security controls have occurred at the required frequency. On the other hand, Requirement 1.2.7 is met by reviewing those configurations as specified in the requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If excessive user rights are not revoked in due time, they may be used by malicious users for unauthorized access.This review provides another opportunity to ensure that accounts for all terminated users have been removed (if any were missed at the time of termination), as well as to ensure that any third parties that no longer need access have had their access terminated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The presence of logs in all environments allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis when something goes wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is very difficult, if not impossible, without a process to corroborate information from critical system components and systems that perform security functions, such as network security controls, IDS/IPS, and file integrity monitoring (FIM) systems. Thus, logs for all critical system components and systems that perform security functions need to be collected, correlated, and maintained. This could include using software products and service methodologies to provide real-time analysis, alerting, and reporting, such as security information and event management (SIEM), FIM, or change detection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
